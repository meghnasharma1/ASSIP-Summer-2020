There should be no reason not to restrict cars. In places like Fairfax County, which have such high populations and also have an underdeveloped public transport system, everyone will naturally resort to buying cars, since they cannot  count on the state to provide effective public transport. The population of Fairfax County, for example, is 1.1 million and every major road is terribly overcrowded. It becomes hard to get anywhere. On the other hand, when I visited the city of Maraş in Turkey, which also has a population of 1.1 million, the only traffic was in the city center, nowhere else. There was such an effective bus system, that I could get from the outskirts of the city into the city center in 20 minutes without waiting more than 10 minutes for buses. With a car, this would take 30 minutes just to make the journey, and there are very few places to park, so it is not unreasonable to spend another 15 or 20 minutes finding a parking spot. In the end, I could get around even easier on a bus.
        Beside the obvious benefit of saving time, it saves many people more money. To filling up a car’s gas tank is around 40-50 dollars spent every month. If you drive more than that gas will be even more expensive, not to mention possible costs for repairs and insurance. It is not unreasonable to say a car can cost more than $100 to keep and maintain every month. My teacher, who lived in Germany before, said that it costed 30 euros to use the train as many times as you wanted for a month. Knowing that, it is obvious to see which method of transportation is cheaper.
        Furthermore, having less cars on the road increases the quality of life. Less cars on the road are less emissions and less traffic, making public transport faster and the air breathable. In some cities in California, they have a ring of smog around the city that negatively affects the health of people.
