It was a average mundane day. I had finished three fourths of my day, and all I had to do was endure 90 minutes of chemistry.  In class, our teacher introduced molecular structures, and for our lab, we used mol mol kits to build structures. Throughout the class, you could hear the clicks of the plastic models being put together and taken apart. We all built cool and unique structures, some people built large complex blobs, and others built small contraptions that they used to spin around. I was fascinated by all the different combinations and structures. It got me thinking, “How did all these different structures affect the physical properties of what was being created. Would different elements or structures make it more durable, heat resistant, or brittle?” While alloys are not molecular bonds, they do share similarities with the lab on molecular structures. My topic, researching how metals can withstand greater temperatures, all depend on elements used and not used.	Heat resistant alloys are combinations of different metals and elements, all combined to make a better material. Originally, metals such as iron, nickel, and cobalt were used when materials needed to withstand extreme temperatures without risking structural integrity. These metals were used in forges, and places with temperatures above 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. Nowadays, with technology improving, the demand for high temperature alloys are increased. Alloys need to withstand extreme amounts of heat for longer periods of time, and have more structural integrityIn 2018, a team of scientists from Japan tested a new alloy(Kamata et al., 2018). Kamata et al.(2018) tested levels of stress for an alloy consisting of titanium carbide, silicon, boron, and molybdenum. The alloy was tested in the temperature range of 1400 - 1600 degrees Celsius for creep strength, which is the tendency for solids to deform under high temperatures and pressure. This alloy displayed very high strength under ultrahigh-temperature ranges, displaying little deformation at 1400 degrees Celsius, rupturing around 400 hours. These results were conducted under a vacuum, so there were very little variables to alter the data. Although this alloy was found to have exceptional creep strength, the experiment was conducted under a vacuum, which prevents oxidation.  K. Yoshimi(personal communication, February 8, 2019), the head of the project, theorizes that adding a sixth or seventh element to the MoSiBTiC alloy will greatly improve oxidation resistance, and says that the current generation of this new alloy is not fully optimized.In February of 2019, another team was researching the effects of titanium and titanium carbide on tungsten based materials (Tejado, Martin, & Pastor, 2019). Tejado et al.(2019) researched how flexural strength, fracture toughness, and high temperature strength would affect pure tungsten when titanium carbide is dispersed throughout the metal. Tungsten is known for its high resistance to heat  due to its high melting point at 3410 degrees Celsius, but Tejado et al.(2019) found that the flexural strength and fracture toughness nearly tripled with dispersed TiC particles compared to pure tungsten. This new alloy retained its strength and properties up to 1200 degrees Celsius, until it started to deform.  However, the brittleness remained the same for both the pure tungsten and the improved alloy. Another limit for tungsten was that it was still highly reactive to oxidation, which could be a major disadvantage once introduced to the real world.During February of 2019, another team of scientists analyzed the effects of a specific element on heat resistant steel(Zhang et al., 2019). They tested the effects of phosphorus impurity in a temperature of 690 degrees Celsius for 8 hours. Zhang et al.(2019) found that the higher the phosphorus content and the more dispersed the phosphorus was, the impact toughness decreased slightly. This meant that the metal was more susceptible to cracking upon impact or high pressures.  Zhang et al.(2019) concluded that phosphorus content can promote the formation of crystal cracks,which leads to increased brittleness and decreased strength, so it is necessary to limit the phosphorus content in the weld metal.There are many numerous benefits that metal alloys have when they are able to withstand extreme heat. They are crucial for energy technologies, such as biomass, concentrated solar energy, solid oxide fuel cells, and nuclear power plants. They are also crucial in many other important technology areas such as jet engines, petrochemistry and materials processing. The ability for these alloys to withstand heat while maintaining its structural properties is crucial, sometimes even life saving. Failures in materials can lead to catastrophes, from electrical malfunctions, to loss of life. What makes this area of research so important is the multiple applications it has, and the variety of solutions there are to creating alloys. Some scientists take the approach of creating alloys that can withstand extreme temperatures for a short amount of time, and others approach creating alloys that can withstand moderate temperatures for longer periods of time. Many new research on alloys are being conducted under controlled environments, which leave many variables unanswered. There are still many unanswered questions, such as how these alloys will perform in oxygen, and their oxidation resistance(Kamata et al., 2018; Tejado et al. 2019), but the future seems promising. The research on improving alloys all use specific elements to improve their properties. Some focus on the element tungsten(Tejado et al. 2019), and other scientists focus on titanium(Kamata et al., 2018), all elements that affect the properties of the alloy. Zhang et al.(2019) even focus on elements that hurt structural integrity, such as phosphorus. When technology improves, metals are required to be able to withstand more heat, pressure, and other variables. The elements being researched today will lead to a safer and more efficient tomorrow.
