I entered the building excited for the future.	The first day of school started of surprisingly bland. I was dragged out of bed around 6:30, a stark contrast to the summer days, where I would rise up at ten or later. I went through my morning routine, getting dressed, brushing my teeth, and washing my face, all while complaining about the time. My eyes were half closed, when suddenly it hit me. It was the first day of middle school. I was suddenly renewed with vigor, and I quickly finished my morning routine. My attitude was very disparate from a few minutes ago. Since it was the first day of school, I had a heavy load school supplies, so I would be driven to school. I would have to wait longer to meet my friends.	As I walked through the doors, I was taken aback. The setting and atmosphere was very different from my elementary school. The front entrance was a large space, where seemingly hundreds of students were standing, catching up with friends, while the teachers were desperately trying to get students to go to their classes. I was eager to meet my friends, but it was time to get to class. Because I wasn’t familiar with the halls, it felt like a labyrinth, where every turn led to more confusion. I would end up being late to class, but my circuitous path would put me on a collision course with old friends. 	As I wandered lost through the halls, I suddenly encountered 2 people whom I could have never expected. I was expecting to see my friends from my elementary school Hunters Woods, where I went for grades three to six. However, these guys were my best friends, not from Hunters Woods, but from a school I thought I had forgot. They were from a different elementary school, Fox Mill, where I attended first and second grade. These two people were some of my best friends in first and second grade, and I vividly remember sitting on the carpet, laughing at something, while the teacher was teaching god knows what.	When I first saw them, it seemed like time stood still. We stopped for a second, taken aback by old memories, but it seemed like a long time. The noise of the crowd seemed to get mute, the other students walking in the halls seemed to slow down, but my mind was racing. I couldn’t believe it! Even though it had been 5 years since I last saw them, their faces were still clear in my head, and still are to this day. We had all grown taller, our styles had changed, but the faces seemed frozen in time, still the blissful young kids that we once were, without the burdens that life would slowly place on us. I was hit with a wave of nostalgia, my mind going back to the good times, when we played in the grass during recess, without a care in the world, when we were inseparable from each other. 	Our exchange was brief. “Yoo, is that you?”  “Henry?”“Its so nice to see you guys again!”“Yeah no kidding, we should catch up sometime”	The short exchange might not look like much to the outside, but it meant a lot to me. It was a window into the past, but it also was a glimpse into the future. It was evident that we would not become such close friends like before. We changed. Our styles differed, our friend groups differed, and our personalities differed. I remember the day we learned that we would be splitting ways and going to different elementary schools in second grade. We made a vow to always stay close, and traded goodbye cards. As much as I wanted to be best buds again, I couldn’t do it. I had new friends, friends who had more similarities and bonds. Nevertheless, I left them with a smile, and we would always be friends. As I wandered into my classroom, I saw my friends greeting me with smiles. Not my old friends, but the new ones I made in Hunters Woods. The friends I bonded with for the last 5 years. The friends that developed the same styles and preferences. Those were the friends I had now.  	The rest of the day went by quick. I met my new classmates, who would soon be new friends, and old friends I reconnected with. I was feeling great when the school ended, with an exciting school year ahead of me.But, as I left school, I couldn’t help but feel sad for all the past memories I would never get back again.
