My family was never very religious, but I remember the first time my parents took me to the local mandir. I marveled at the beautiful marble statues, the deities decked out in glistening cloth and decorated with beads. Before sitting down, my mom and I walked around the back side of our local temple, Rajdhani Mandir. There, smaller deities were placed, clear that equal attention had been given to them as the large ones in the front from the offerings placed on the small platforms. One of the statues had a long explanation on the wall behind it. My mom stood, hands clasped, as she read the text. I couldn’t and still cannot read Hindi or Sanskrit, so I stood there, awestruck by the amount of care given to the details in the sacred space. As we walked around the back, I remember recognizing Hanuman, the part human, part monkey character featured in the Ramayana. This deity was the only one I could recognize. As a small child, I distinctly remember wondering if one gave too much attention to one god if the others would be angry. After finishing our walk around the prayer hall, we stood in line for prashad, food blessed by the gods. As I held out my hands for the holy water, the priest corrected me to hold one hand beneath the other so the water wouldn’t spill through the gaps in my fingers. I don’t remember sitting down and listening to the stories from the priests, but my mom tells me I was good and was able to sit in one place for the duration of the lectures. Every summer until 5th or 6th grade, either my grandma or aunt would come over to look after me and my brother while my parents were working. My aunt, or buaji, as I most often called her, was trying to learn English. I remember her notebook filled with neat handwriting written in blue pen. I was mesmerized by her methodical learning process as she pored over books. One summer, my cousin and a different aunt were able to come over, less for looking after us and more for my cousin to see different things in the U.S. This aunt, whom I called Chintha Bua, made a formidable attempt to teach me Hindi, with little success. I wasn’t a good student and didn’t practice much, and there was only so much I could learn in a short summertime. These relatives were the only ones I know on a personal level. I only hear about the many others from what my parents tell me. One day, coming back from what was probably another prep class, somehow my dad and I started talking about his family and life in India. He told me about a small poor village in the middle of nowhere. Our family surname implies Brahmin origin, the top caste of the Hindu system of society. However, it seemed like my father’s family was even worse off than the rest of the others in the village. In this small village, and many villages like it that still exist in India today, the caste system still had social implications. My dad said that his uncle became a priest only because he was told to, not because he wanted to. He would go around fooling the villagers with faked remedies and the placebo effect, but only because it was the only way to survive. My dad asked his uncle if he believed in God or the remedies or rituals. The answer was no. He didn’t believe in any of it. My dad told me it was remarkable how honest he had been; how, as a priest, refusing to fool his young nephew into his nonexistent belief in God, he told my dad the truth. As my dad continued talking about his childhood, I realized how little I knew my extended family. On an unfriendly sunny afternoon in summer, my mom was trying to convince me to talk to one of my relatives on the phone one day. I don’t remember which one. I awkwardly said “hello”. The reply came. As the conversation went on, if it possible to call our fragmented one-way small talk about school a conversation, my mom had to translate more and more. This entire ‘conversation’ lasted less than a few minutes. When asked with an explanation for why I couldn’t understand Hindi, my mom replied with an explanation that I could easily understand my mom’s Hindi in person but wasn’t used to others speaking over the phone. If I talked more often, it would get more comfortable for me to understand what they were saying. The reply came with surprise. Their Hindi was just the same as my mom’s Hindi. Why couldn’t I understand? I don’t have an explanation other than my Hindi was terrible and has gotten worse since then. This wasn’t the first time something like this had happened. These phone calls experiences with extended family usually occur once every 6 months. I make a cameo on a Facetime saying hello, then after answering some question about school I make an excuse about work that I’m not going to do and leave. This three-minute conversation is the longest time I can remember I’ve talked over the phone with a relative. At my friend Fatima’s house, I remember one time not being able to understand her mom speaking Urdu to me. Urdu is quite like Hindi, enough that I should have been able to understand the question she was asking me. However, I responded with nothing but a confused look on my face. Fatima and I laughed as I continued to struggle at understanding the simplest of sentences. The question came again: what had happened to my skill of understanding Hindi I possessed not long ago? I argued with my mom recently about going to the temple. Her point was that going to the temple would help me learn Hindi again. This point is invalid because one cannot learn a language by listening to someone speak for hours. Language is learned through back and forth interaction. My mom continued her circuitous talk, insisting that she was correct. Her persistence only exacerbated my anger toward myself and my diminishing Hindi ability. When my mom occasionally persuades me to go to the temple today, I still marvel at the beauty of the prayer hall. However, I still don’t recognize most of the deities, including the one my mom always pauses at to read the text above. Usually a visit to the mandir is a couple hours of listening to the priest or guest speaker tell a story with some kind of moral relating to God. Or so I’m told. Out of a two hour lecture, I can understand a couple words at best. The stories are usually complex Hindi or maybe Sanskrit, not the Hindi I used to be used to. However, my mom doesn’t believe me when I tell her how little I understood. I sit restlessly on the floor, fidgeting and checking my watch until the two hours are over.
