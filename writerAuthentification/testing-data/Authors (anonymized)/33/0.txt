We went on a field trip to see behind the scenes of the process of conservation at the Lunder conservation center. I had already seen some processes behind conservation from two Girls in Technology behind the scenes tours at the Udvar-Hazy museum. These experiences introduced me to the processes that take place behind the scenes to preserve pieces of history for the future. I was fascinated by the different materials, and techniques used. As the year in chemistry progresses, one memorable combination of experiments caught my attention. Using different materials, we observed different chemical reactions taking place, from a copper wire reacting with the oxygen in the air and turning a matte grey color to the bright light caused by holding a magnesium ribbon over a flame, to even the Bunsen burners fueled by methane in the chemistry lab. We went through several experiments and wrote out the balanced equations for each one. As I remember the experiences behind the labs on the tours of conservation centers, I wondered of these reactions being applied to this field. Paper conservation is a wide field. Different glues are used to mend tears in old artifacts but need to be reversible, stable and not change in apperance, and have low bioreceptivity. Coatings are used to prevent further degradation in the paper and protect it. Acidification of paper relics leads to hydrolysis in the cellulose (Huang, Liang, Lu, & Zhang, 2018) and is another factor to consider and counter. However, some of the commonly used methods can cause damge to paper artifacts (Biccheri & Soho, 2016). Research in this field is important to optimized the preservation of paper relics A study conducted by Afsharpour and Imani (2017) studied the potential of nanostructured zinc oxide, which can be used as a protective coating because of its unique properties as a metal oxide. The samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Zinc oxide has been used in art as a white pigment, but the nanostructured coating is transparent. [Information from correspondence about nanostructured coating here] After ageing, no significant difference could be observed in the structure of the papers coated with zinc oxide. After thermal ageing, the uncoated paper was lower in strength than the coated ones. This could be attributed to the effect of the zinc oxide particles on the bonding between fibers in the paper. Another common cause of deterioration in paper artifacts is light. Zinc oxide can aid against this, absorbing UV light while protecting the precious colors underneath from faded, as long as the zinc oxide isnâ€™t used directly on the paper. This preventative coating made of nanostructured zinc oxide could be a valuable tool in protecting works of art. Different adhesives are used to mend tears in the preservation of paper but come with different advantages and disadvantages. Adhesives are evaluated on many characteristics, including stability and receptivity to being invaded by organisms, and need to be reversible. In a study performed by Borges, Casimiro, Macedo, and Sequeria (2018), five of the most commonly used adhesives in paper conservation were compared on these traits. After artifical ageing was induces, the results were compared. Starch paste was found to be the most stable but most bioreceptive. Starch paste is most popular adhesive used (Alexopoulou & Zervos, 2016) and most conservators use it on paper already colonized by organisms (Borges et al., 2018). Carboxymethylcellulose and Archibond were found the least bioreceptive but the least stable. The carboxymethylcellulose did not maintain its transparant apperance after ageing and was yellow in apperance after ageing. The Archibond samples also yellowed over time. Methylcellulose and hydroxypropylcellulose had a mix between the two traits. Methylcellulose is the second most popular choice for paper repairs (Alexopoulou & Zervos, 2016). All the adhesives tested do acidify over time. The acidification of paper works increases the hydrolysis of the cellulose contained within them has detrimental side effects such as a decrease in strength and visual effects of discoloration or darkening of the colors. Calcium hydroxide has been shown to be an effective method of increasing pH but may be a harmful treatment (Biccheri & Sodo, 2016). In a study by Biccheri and Sodo (2016), calcium propionate was found to be another option that counters the hydrolysis of cellulose. The most stable treatment in this experiment used both calcium propionate to neutralize the paper and borane tert-butylamine as a reduction agent to change harmful carbonyls into harmless hydroxyls. In a different study, conducted by Huang, Liang, Lu, and Zhang, a treatment using oleic acid-modified magnsium oxide particles was shown to be effective in raising the pH enough to reduce degradation. This treatment was tested on Xuan paper, a type of Chinese hand-made paper, unlike Biccheri and Soho (2016) testing on Whatman cellulose chromatography paper. After ageing tests, the untreated papers showed a higher decrease in pH than the papers treated with oleic acid-modified magnsium oxide. The treated papers showed better tensile strength than the untreated papers. The oleic acid-modified magnisum oxide treatment changed the treated papers to be hydrophobic. The conservation and preservation of paper is important to preserving our history for today and the future generations. As I remember walking through the conservation center, I was awed by the lengths taken to preserve pieces of history. Careful, meticulous research is being done to further these methods used in the lab and take the steps to better preserve our history.
