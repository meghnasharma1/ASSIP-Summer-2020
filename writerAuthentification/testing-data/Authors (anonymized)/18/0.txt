There was certainly no musical talent in the family.Me, Mom, and Dad, it’s just the three of us. I grew up in Mississippi, in the old city of Starkville. I was blessed to be raised in an open fashion, allowed to develop my own values and interests. In elementary school, I tried nearly everything—I can vividly remember my pair of grass-stained shin guards, rigid yet soothing on the skin. Every school day the bitter sound of bells that rang at precisely at 2:45 PM. The smell of cracked white paint over the old cinder block walls of my piano teacher’s house. At 85 years old, he noticed that I had a gift for music. I could sing and play scales simultaneously, something that he rarely saw. 	When my father opted for a government job in 2010, my life took a turn. The sense of a close-knit community became a modern network of all sorts of high-achieving, fast paced people. The old gray asphalt roads of our old cul-de-sac that I was accustomed to were now stations for the new metrobus fleet. My music lessons fizzled out to a minimum, and I needed time to adjust to the rigor of school, which my parents insisted was above all. All around me, my peers excelled in competitions of all sorts, boasting their achievements in person and through means of social media. But I, all I had were my memories of Mississippi. Memories that I brought with me but could not access anymore. I was in 6th grade when I found an escape: the school band.	The spotlights brightened above the stage. I gazed up at the vast auditorium ceiling. A sophomore, I was sitting among Fairfax County’s most accomplished musicians in Senior Regional Orchestra. I caught a glimpse of my mom in the front row of the audience. This was it. The distinct sound of cellos and double basses surfaced, starting the first movement. Then the trumpets entered with short sounds of dissonance, only to be resolved by the first violins glissing to the major third. I shut my eyes, immersed in overtones that rang from the concert master's bow to the tuba’s bell. The tip of the maestro’s baton drew me back into reality. A gradual decrescendo hints at a trombone chorale coming up. My lungs inflate from the bottom up, and the air flows with ease. I close my eyes and let the instrument sing. Pure euphoria. This was moment where everything paid off. It was the moment I finally knew who I was destined to become.	During the car ride home, I was quick to break the news of my new conclusion: “Mom, I want to become a professional musician, I want to attend a music school, I need to be around talented musicians...” the words tumbled out of my mouth. I knew that I could stand semesters of music theory courses, afternoons in a practice room, and hours of critique. I was adamant. Mom tilted her head toward the rear view mirror. I nervously awaited a response, a response that did not come the entire ride back. I knew to stay silent. 	Mom and I sat at opposite ends of a small, round table in the center of the kitchen. She calmly addressed the issue, the same way she used to back in my elementary school days. “Evan,” she started. “The real world is hard. Classical music is declining, and it will not come back. Many conservatories will close, many marginal symphony orchestras will fold and I predict retrenchment in the arts. Back before your dad and I met, we played in an orchestra for a living.” I was startled. 	Later that week, Mom talked about her experiences playing in China's national orchestra. I was heaven, but she dreamed of more. She took every possible opportunity to immigrate to the United States, to live the American dream. She placed a wrinkled leather photo album on the table and began dusting off the cover. A bright red star appeared to be woven into the first page. We looked through pictures of the lively conductors, famous players, and governments officials. There was one photo in particular that stood out to me. It showed the symphony hall from the musician’s point of view, with hundreds of seats on multiple stories. “There she is.” Mom points at a woman sitting in the front row. It’s Grandma.
