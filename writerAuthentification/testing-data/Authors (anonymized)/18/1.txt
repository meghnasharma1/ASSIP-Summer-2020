The packaging seemed overly durable, a hard plastic shell wrapped in thick yellow duct tape with warnings of radioactivity. It was the radioactive isotope cesium-137, and next to it was a Geiger-Muller counter. As the cesium was decaying, the number on the Geiger counter rapidly increased. The radioactive isotope was undergoing beta decay, giving off electrons and energy, becoming a more stable element, barium. I then realized certain radioactive isotopes were almost tangible forms of radiation, ready to emit radiation without any outside source of energy. Surely, this source of constant radiation could be used in medical procedures, especially in cancer treatment, I thought. Not only was that true, but treatment of a more specific type of cancer, thyroid cancer, had many applications of radioactive isotopes.A radioisotope, or radioactive isotope, is the unstable form of an element that emits radiation to transform into a more stable form. This radiation is easily traceable and can cause changes in the substance it falls upon, possibly targeting cancer cells. During thyroid cancer treatment, a radioisotope such radioiodine is taken into the body in liquid or capsule form. With little effect on the rest of the body, the radioiodine concentrates in thyroid cells, and its radiation can destroy the thyroid gland and any other cancerous thyroid cells that take up iodine (Jarzab & Krajewska, 2018).        	The production of many new isotopes with suitable half-life for treatment and diagnostic of various cancers is an important topic in research. (Deilami-nezhad, Moghaddam-Banaem, Sadeghi, & Asgari, 2016). Deilami-nezhad et al. (2016) produced Scandium-47 radionuclide by irradiating the natural titanium dioxide powder (TiO2) in the fast neutron flux for 4 days in Tehran Research Reactor in Iran. Scandium is a rare element from which different radionuclides with medicinal potential, since it has desirable nuclear properties due to it naturally being a       β-emitter, decaying to the ground state of 47Ti and to the 159 keV excited state of 47Ti with only a 3.35 day half-life (Deilami-nezhad, Moghaddam-Banaem, Sadeghi, & Asgari, 2016). The scientists obtained a separation efficiency and radiochemical purity of radio-scandium of 98% and 99% respectively. A high, 88% radionuclide purity was achieved, suggesting the feasibility of Sc-47 production (Deilami-nezhad, Moghaddam-Banaem, Sadeghi, & Asgari, 2016).        	A study by Gray et al. (2019) used the standard radioiodine instead, reviewing more than 1,500 patients treated for papillary thyroid cancer at high-volume centers in France and the United States from 2004–2014. The researchers aimed to determine the effect of adjuvant radioactive iodine dose on recurrence rate in high-risk papillary thyroid cancer. More specifically, they aimed to identify the benefit of high-dose radioactive iodine (RAI) (≥150 mCi) versus intermediate-dose RAI (100 mCi). The corresponding researcher Dr. Fahey (personal communication, February 13, 2019) stated that there was an equation that forms the basis of RAI treatment, the beta-emission equation . Before RAI administration, all patients underwent total thyroidectomy by a general surgeon trained in endocrine surgery with at least 5 years of experience. Both hospital systems provide high-volume, specialized care in endocrine surgery. Patients underwent preoperative workup at the discretion of the clinical team, consisting of baseline ultrasound imaging of the thyroid and cervical lymph nodes, fine needle biopsy, and baseline thyroid hormone levels (Gray et al., 2019). Their data concluded high-dose RAI is associated with lower recurrence rate compared to intermediate-dose RAI for patients with high-risk papillary thyroid cancer.However, out of all patients with thyroid cancer, approximately 5% have radioactive iodine-refractory cancer, resistant to radiation treatment. Recent research done by Jeon et al. (2019) examined the use of the Slit2 protein as a tumor suppressor in thyroid cancer. Slits, representative axon guidance molecules, and their roundabout transmembrane receptors play roles in the progression of many cancers (Jeon et al., 2019). The researchers collected full length Slit2 cDNA as well as human thyroid cancer cell lines BCPAP, 8505C, and SW173. These were then plated together in 96-well plates and incubated for 3 days or 5 days. Jeon et al. (2019) concluded that Slit2 suppressed not only thyroid cancer cell proliferation, but also cell migration and invasion by regulating transcriptional activity of beta-catenin and the beta-catenin/E-cadherin complex formation and by controlling the activation state of Rho GTPase. Introduction of Slit2 may be an alternative to the standard radioactive iodine treatment.Not only has radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid cancer had a huge impact on the treatment options of patients, radioiodine administration leads to both direct and indirect radiobiological effects on affected tissues. A direct effect is that ionization of the thyroid cells may results in DNA damage, whereas an indirect effect is the production of free radicals that react with the critical macromolecules (Jarzab & Krajewska, 2018). Nonetheless, new drugs for the treatment of iodine-refractory thyroid cancer have already emerged in recent years. In 2018, the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine introduced a kinase inhibitor called cabozantinib, which blocks enzymes that are crucial to a cancer cell's ability to function (Infanti, 2018). Though responses to these treatments are not durable, they may give way to a larger, multi-center study.        	Once the cutting-edge discovery of the time, radioisotopes appear in thousands of research articles and are highly applicable in many fields due to their unique ability to sustain the emission of radiation. However, the treatment for more advanced thyroid cancers requires new innovation in medical technology. Something as powerful as radioactive isotopes, though not without the warning symbols of its own.
