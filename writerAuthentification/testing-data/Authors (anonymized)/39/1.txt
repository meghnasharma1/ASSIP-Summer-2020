“The green reed that bends in the wind is stronger than the mighty oak that breaks in a storm” - Confucius. Sometimes in life, you don’t get what you want, but you stumble across something better in the process. I was seven years old when I first picked up a tennis racket. Summer’s punishing rays had begun their onslaught on all who dared venture out of their air-conditioned homes and their arrival signaled the beginning of a seven-hour void of time that had to be filled. To put it simply, I needed something to do. My parents had recently begun playing tennis, and they decided I should play, too. I started with group lessons, wide-eyed little kids on gray clay courts, running around with our rackets held high above our petite heads. My first instructor was Steve, and he was the head instructor and introduced me and many others to tennis. I quickly caught on to the basic principle of childhood tennis. Hit the ball hard, and other people will miss. I continued to progress throughout that summer, and when fall came around I decided to take private lessons. I would finish school on Fridays and go to tennis to continue working on my skills. It got tedious at times, the hitting, the serving, the volleying, the running, but I stuck with it, I improved.	When I was ten-years-old, Steve introduced a new tennis program, USTA tennis. USTA is the main organization for tennis in the US and it sponsors kids tennis programs all across the country. The plan was to make teams of 10, 12, and 14-year-olds to play against other teams in the area. However, it didn’t quite go as planned. We had a striking lack of players in almost all divisions. We rarely had any players 12 or older available to play in the higher age groups. So instead the best 10-year-olds would play in the 14s so we wouldn’t forfeit matches. It was hectic. I would have 2-3 matches in a week throughout the summer. In our first year as a team, we won a grand total of zero matches. However, we kept trying. As new players joined and we all got older, our team improved, and we all became friends.	As I approached high school, I started to think about sports. In most high schools, the main sports of football, basketball, and baseball are all extremely competitive. But, tennis is not as sought after, and as someone who had been playing for a long time. I had a good chance of making a high school team. However, after making it into TJ, I became cognizant of the fact that TJ’s tennis team is a juggernaut with 5 straight state titles and a myriad of talented players riding the bench, so my chances of making it on the team were slim. Knowing this, I still wanted to play a sport in high school, but I couldn’t fully rely on tennis to allow me to. Then I thought of baseball, I hadn’t played baseball for as long as I had played tennis, but I was still respectable.	There was only one problem with this great idea, tennis and baseball are both spring sports. That means I could only play one of them, I had to choose, tennis or baseball. Should I go for broke or hedge my bets? This problem was compounded by the fact that baseball and tennis had tryouts during the same week. In my attempt to make a decision, I went to offseason programs for both sports, and couldn’t decide. So I thought to myself, why not try both? I talked with both coaches and worked out a personal schedule where I could try out for both sports. I was ecstatic. I would be able to go for the long shot and the safe bet. So I kept working, I prepared for tennis and I prepared for baseball. I threw pitches, and hit serves, I mashed baseballs and finessed volleys. I counted the days till tryouts.	So when spring tryouts came around, I was excited. I wanted to push my limits. First came tennis. My dreams didn’t come to fruition. I scraped through my first two matches before being bested in a third. Luckily for me, in baseball, things went better. I was able to make the JV team. However, this wasn’t an accomplishment since no one was cut. So I began my daily baseball journey. It was difficult. We worked hard before the season started to prepare ourselves for the stiff competition we knew we would face. Every day we would go to the baseball field to throw, hit, and run. But as the season went on we all came together as a team. We were in it together, trying to win together, and we improved together. TJ JV baseball finished the season at 8-6-1 with the tie coming against our rival, Marshall.	With all the new friends I made in baseball, I think it worked out well that I was able to play a sport like baseball. Everyone has to rely on each other to do their job, and we all work hard to improve. I continue to talk with these people I met in baseball and will enjoy playing baseball again with them this spring. This experience has taught me that I can adapt to unexpected circumstances and still have enjoyable experiences along the way.
