E. Coli, Hepatitis A, Salmonella, what do these diseases all have in common? They can all be spread through food, and they can all be prevented by gamma irradiation. Radiation is a key part of our world today, from protecting ourselves from it, to using it. I found that out when Mrs. Chhabra explained the dinging in the Geiger counter. Food irradiation can help developing countries obtain access to clean food and drink, as well as improve our food safety mechanisms here in the US.  	Ionizing radiation was discovered by Röntgen and Becquerel in 1985 and was immediately recommended for therapeutic use (Ehlermann, 2016, p. 10). Food irradiation is a natural branch of ionizing radiation, and it is designed to kill pathogens in food (Feliciano, 2018, p. 34). In 1906, Appleby and Banks got a patent in the United Kingdom to use a flower bed system to irradiate food, however it was not commercially adapted because only a small amount of food could be irradiated at a time (Ehlermann, 2016, p. 10). Eisenhower’s atoms for peace program brought new attention worldwide to food irradiation and led to the first commercial food irradiation in 1958 (Ehlermann, 2016, p. 11). Since then, food irradiation has continued to develop into an established and safe technology, but it still deals with customers’ fears about radiation in their food (Ehlermann, 2016, p. 12).In February 2018, researchers at the center of Biological Engineering at Minho University studied how gamma food irradiation affected the amount of Ochratoxin A (OTA) in  solids and liquids (Calado, Fernández-Cruz, Verde, Venâncio, & Abrunhosa, 2018, p. 463). OTA is a mycotoxin created by fungi and it is nephrotoxic and a possible carcinogen (Calado, Fernández-Cruz, Verde, Venâncio, & Abrunhosa, 2018, p. 463). This means it is dangerous to the kidneys and it may cause cancer (Calado, Fernández-Cruz, Verde, Venâncio, & Abrunhosa, 2018, p. 463). OTA is currently controlled by good agricultural storage practices (Calado, Fernández-Cruz, Verde, Venâncio, & Abrunhosa, 2018, p. 463). The researchers found when OTA was dissolved in water, they were able to remove up to 98% of it with gamma radiation (Calado, Fernández-Cruz, Verde, Venâncio, & Abrunhosa, 2018, p. 466). Similar results occurred in water/methanol solutions, with 97% removed at the highest dose (Calado, Fernández-Cruz, Verde, Venâncio, & Abrunhosa, 2018, p. 466). However, when OTA was in its dry form, the highest dose of radiation only removed 12% of the OTA. For all trials the highest dose was 8.6 kGy (Calado, Fernández-Cruz, Verde, Venâncio, & Abrunhosa, 2018, p. 466). This means that gamma food irradiation is not very effective at removing OTA in the majority of foods, so it is unlikely it will replace current preventive methods of OTA contamination prevention (Calado, Fernández-Cruz, Verde, Venâncio, & Abrunhosa, 2018, p. 470).In November 2018, researchers in the FDA studied whether furan is produced when fruit juices are exposed to gamma radiation (Morehouse, Perez, & McNeal, 2018, p. 81). Furan is a volatile chemical that is a possible carcinogen in humans (Morehouse, Perez, & McNeal, 2018, p. 82). Furan has reportedly been produced by both food irradiation and heat-pasteurization of fruit juices (Morehouse, Perez, & McNeal, 2018, p. 82). The researchers found that furan was mostly non-detectable in fresh fruit juice, with small amounts in pasteurized fruit juices (Morehouse, Perez, & McNeal, 2018, p.86). However, in gamma irradiation fruit juices, the amount of furan increased at higher doses and was measurable at all doses (Morehouse, Perez, & McNeal, 2018, p. 86). The researchers also found that the two most likely precursor compounds to furan in fruit juices were ascorbic acid and sucrose (Morehouse, Perez, & McNeal, 2018, p. 87). This means new methods need to be found to preserve fruit juice, such as freezing before irradiation, which reduced furan concentrations in this experiment (Morehouse, Perez, & McNeal, 2018, p. 88).In January 2019, researchers studied the effect of labeling of irradiated foods on how customers viewed the quality of those foods (Bearth & Siegrist, 2019, p. 141). Many studies have determined that consumers rarely accept new technology in their food such as genetically modified foods (Bearth & Siegrist, 2019, p. 142). The researchers found that the perceived quality of foods decreased significantly when treated with irradiation was put on the food, but the perceived quality did not decrease significantly when treated with ionization was put on the food (Bearth & Siegrist, 2019, p. 144). This shows the negative connotations of irradiation, but not ionization (Bearth & Siegrist, 2019, p. 144). The researchers also studied the effect of someone's perception of nuclear power on their perception of food irradiation (Bearth & Siegrist, 2019, p. 146). They found the more negative someone’s perception of nuclear power was, their perception of food irradiation was generally lower (Bearth & Siegrist, 2019, p. 146). This shows that companies have to work in order to package their products accurately while appealing to consumers (Bearth & Siegrist, 2019, p. 147).This research is important because it allows pathogens to be removed from food easily and inexpensively. Many developing countries do not have access to clean food, and by developing gamma irradiation technology, we can increase food quality. We also need to find out which foods and drinks are not safe with gamma irradiation. We want to make sure we are not causing new problems with this technology. Careful research into precursor compounds and possible toxins has and will prevent issues with this technology. I have attempted to email scientists about their important research, but I have yet to hear a response. Overall, gamma irradiation has the potential to prevent food quality issues throughout the world.Gamma irradiation is not a new technology, but new research and applications can help improve safety and efficiency. Gamma irradiation technology fills a pressing need for food quality control. The public still has not accepted food irradiation, but when shown its effectiveness in preventing the foodborne-illness outbreaks, they may be swayed. It is important that researchers continue to ensure that gamma irradiation is safe by identifying dangerous compounds and using different methods of food quality control on those food items. Gamma irradiation is the future in food safety everywhere.
