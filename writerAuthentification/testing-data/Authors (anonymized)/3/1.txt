The Intermolecular Forces Lab was somewhat confusing to me when I tried to do it. Although the procedures seemed easy, the background on different types of intermolecular forces was something that I had never thought of before. I decided to do some extra research and became more interested in the topic, finding that all intermolecular forces are commonly referred to as van der Waals forces. It was due to this curiosity that I uncovered the Casimir force - a logic-defying force which piqued my interest further. Although the force was relatively unheard of from my classmates, it held some of the most important impacts I could conceive, and I felt obligated to research on it to better understand its importance and current applicability.	After J.D. van der Waals defined the van der Waals force between atoms, scientists found that as particles moved apart, their attractive force decreased at a faster rate than those specified in recent quantum theories (Ghorotkhar, 2016). Hendrik Casimir, a Dutch scientist, used his theoretical knowledge to predict another force which could explain this. He demonstrated this by placing two parallel mirrors in a vacuum. As the mirrors moved closer together (up to 1 micron apart), a force began to exist, irregardless of the fact that a vacuum was present (Lambrecht, 2002). This is due to both the uncertainty principle, which allows for energy, and quantum fluctuations in the vacuum (Pinto, 2018).	Tang et al. (2017) focus on the potential to measure the Casimir force in unconventionally shaped structures. Although the Casimir force seems to be an interesting prospect for microscopic attraction, Casimir’s 1948 setup is not viable, because of the ideal state of the mirrors (including thickness and parallel alignment). In order to bypass the need for alignment, they use a system of embedded sensors and actuators to measure the Casimir force in nanodevices. They used unconventional T-shaped plates with corrugated surfaces and used the embedded sensors to measure the force and compare with empirical results. Their findings showed that the unconventional plate shape created a non-monotonic decrease in the attraction, which means that the attraction doesn’t necessarily strictly decrease as the plates are pulled apart. Because electrostatic interference was minimized, these results are highly credible.	Wang, Kang, & Yang (2017) focus on decreasing electrostatic interference/pull-in instability in microplates, and how factors such as surface behavior (e.g. thickness) and thermal loading in a microplate relates to the Casimir force. The paper is based on Eringen’s nonlocal elasticity theory, which looks at forces such as electrostatic force and thermal Casimir force (which is Casimir force arising from thermal fluctuations in conjunction with quantum fluctuations). Using a coupling system, the scientists were able to mix and match different attributes, such as thermal loading, surface behavior, Casimir force, and electrostatic force. The scientists found that at distances greater than 100 nanometers, the thermal Casimir force decreases electrostatic interference more than the Casimir force. They also find that electrostatic force is subject to environmental temperature change, and that the microplate service can affect the electrostatic force if the microplate is too brittle.	Xu, Klimchitskaya, Mostepanenko, & Mohideen (2018) discuss the harms of electrostatic forces on microdevices employing the Casimir force, and how to reduce them. It opens by stating that the use of nanodevices is made impractical by the interference of electrostatic forces in the Casimir force. They demonstrate a method for eliminating electrostatic forces, by using an ionized argon beam to clean off any impurities in the plates and increase the accuracy of the results. The authors make note that the use of argon cleaning isn’t necessarily meant to be implemented in nanodevices, but rather used as a tool in experimenting with the Casimir force itself. After undergoing repeated trials with argon cleaning, the authors found that the use of argon is key to cleaning plates that are crucial to the force itself. I tried to begin an email chain with Professor Umar Mohideen of the University of California to press him on the viability of argon beams in the field, but he hasn’t responded to me.	The major problem with implementing nanodevices is the surface area to volume ratio. Because devices are moving from microdevices to nanodevices, proportional forces such as electromagnetic, frictional, and adhesive increase by a lot. Friction is especially detrimental, because it decreases the dependability and the lifespan of the nanodevice itself (Lu & Gao, 2011). Because the Casimir force can be manipulated, if scientists were able to reduce the force between nanocomponents, it would greatly enhance the efficiency and widespread use of such devices. Nanodevices are incredibly helpful in many different ways: they can be used as actuators and sensors, help in automotive work, increased environmental testing, and increased efficiency with medical diagnosis and treatment (Crone).	There are still many questions about the Casimir force. Some examples are whether all types of interference can be eliminated, how it would operate inside an enclosed object (i.e., a sphere), and if it could be a source of zero-point energy. Regardless, there are still many steps to take to transform a force between two nonconducting metallic plates into a force which can increase computational efficiency. It would require an increased amount of testing and understanding to be applied more in the field. Although a lot of research currently exists, it will be a long time until scientists are able to understand what exactly the force is and how it interacts with other forces.
