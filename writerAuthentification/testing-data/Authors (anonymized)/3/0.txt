I am not by nature an argumentative person, but I have become one. I am an active high school debater – I debate on resolutions, the nature of debate, critical education, and the impacts of actions. I often times wonder how tantamount my debating persona is to the way I behave.	I can distinctly remember the night before one of my most memorable debate tournaments. It was late at night and I was in my room, alone with only my thoughts, when suddenly, I had a grounding epiphany – I had fallen into a general sense of complacency. Instead of wracking my brain around complex philosophy during that night, my brain kept lulling me back to that same thought. Deciding to sleep on it, the next morning greeted me with optimistic promises. I forgot all about my striking realization and headed into the debate doing what I prepared to do, and did quite well.	It was only during the car ride home, after a day of success, after I had experience all of the praise, that I had pinpointed the source of it. Debating on issues on both sides, always being wary of information, always wanting to find the next revolutionary case strategy which would win me the round, had lowered my moral barometer of what is appropriate. My dad had fallen silent in the car, knowing that I was deep in thought. My mind lost focus, and I began to hear again – the cars passing by me, the serene views from the car window, the radio blabbering on about something so inane that my brain manually censored it.	I asked my dad how he became successful, not expecting a verbose two-hour long speech filled with motivational and moving points, but that’s exactly what I received. My dad himself wasn’t the most ambitious person growing up; he was involved in many college activities and on a whim, was allowed to go to the US as part of a training program for noncitizens. There, he worked his way up the ladder. He moved from business job to business job, never being satisfied by what life offered him. He worked past the clock literally, staying up until 1am every day working on achieving his goals. If there was a textbook on ambition, he would be on the cover.	I’m certainly not like that. Although moved, his language seemed almost alien to me. Being raised in a different setting with different privileges had attributed to a general lack of angst and hunger to succeed, and hearing someone who eats a breakfast made of ambition talk about his life story certainly didn’t satisfy my need to find direction in my life.	 Maybe ambition exists outside of what I perceive as my culture, but that certainly didn’t deter me from continuing to think about my purpose. We got home and I fell silent. I should have been celebrating, but instead, I went upstairs to the same room, changed into the same clothes, and fell into the same bed, wondering the same thoughts.	I didn’t know who to turn to. My mom’s story is and always will be intertwined with my dad’s, and I never talked to my brother about those things. I still decided to head up to his room and ask him about it. My brother’s personality is quite the antithesis of my dad’s. My dad is outgoing and participated in many activities in college, while my brother is more introverted and works in media. I asked him why/how he “made it”, and his answer wasn’t as terse as I expected – in fact, it was far from it. He started out pursuing a degree in medicine, mainly because our parents wanted him to do and they were less liberal in his upbringing. He was unsatisfied with himself and instead of deliberating over it, he did what he wanted to do as a side hobby. He started up his own media channel and worked by himself, to the point where my parents are fans of him and the work that he dedicates to his craft.	The story resonated with me, and I sat down on a couch outside my room as I thought about it. Maybe I am not the most ambitious person to exist in the last century. Maybe I haven’t found a calling which leaves me satisfied. Maybe I won’t succeed. Maybe, maybe, maybe – it’s a word that praises inaction and scatterbrained thought. But, then again, maybe I’m just a debater who has lost a compass of morality on a search for meaning. Something that I don’t take as a maybe is that life is not a zero sum game. I have let my activities change the way that I behave, but maybe it’s time that I choose and explore activities which lead to a fulfilling journey through this rollercoaster called life.
