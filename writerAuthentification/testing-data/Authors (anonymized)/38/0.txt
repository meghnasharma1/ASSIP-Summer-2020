The plane had just landed at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad, India, and we were quickly ferried off with our luggage. My family and I rushed to get through the security terminals and outside to the car. All of us were exhausted from the nonstop flight of more than twelve hours and wanted to get to my aunt’s house as soon as possible. Our uncle picked us up from the airport and we got into the car. Immediately, we were hit with a barrage of traffic heading into the city. The loud honks from every car startled me at first, but I soon got used to it. I wanted to lower the windows because of the extreme heat, but my uncle instead turned on the air conditioning. I quickly saw why. As we drove, beggars were walking between the cars, knocking on the windows. Some of them looked grotesque, missing an arm or having scars on their face, while others looked almost completely healthy. I quickly looked away from them while my parents shook their heads “no” to the beggars, continuing their conversation. My parents were hardened to this, having seen this, and worse, ever since they were born. They also knew the facts about Indian beggars - many of them would not be able to keep the money for long, as it would end up going to the leader of that “begging group”, and many others choose to deliberately main themselves to garner more sympathy, and thus, get more money. My sister, unlike me, looked curiously at the beggars. Seeing someone directly look at them - a possibility of money - they quickly aggregated around our car. Realizing her mistake, she turned her head to the side and the beggars left.	After an hour, we reached my aunt’s house. It was a safe haven from the chaos that was Hyderabad. We entered their house and I, almost immediately, ran to the restroom. I walked in and said to myself, “What in the world is this?”	There was no actual toilet - just a hole in the ground and a bucket of water. This was a vast contrast from the western world, with its developed technology. India became known as the most undeveloped and uncivilized country in the world, at least in my mind. At that point, I just wanted to go home and for this harrowing visit to be over.	My parents had lived in India from birth to their 20s. They had an arranged marriage, as was usual in those times and still is now. It was less than a week from my parents meeting to the marriage, which was just four days before my dad left for the United States. After my dad left for the US, my mom came almost a year later. From then to my sister’s birth, they made frequent visits to India to see family and friends. These visits slowed down after my sister was born, and even more so after I was. However, we did still visit, although infrequently. This was the first visit in which I wasn’t an infant and could understand the conditions.	After spending more time in Hyderabad with our cousins, we went to another aunt’s house more than 350 miles away in Visakhapatnam, commonly known as Vizag. This was a coastal city, bordering the Bay of Bengal. It had many beaches, which I had known about beforehand, and accordingly, brought swim shorts. However, when I later asked my mom, she simply said, “No. It’s too dangerous.”	When I persistently nagged her for more info, she told me about the beaches. There were never any lifeguards there and the water could be unpredictable. Every year, some people would drown, mostly young people - students or kids who get separated from their parents.We met up with our cousins in Vizag at their house and later went with them to a town called Repalle, our final major destination. This was where the parents of my father lived. Within walking distance of their house was a hospital. Similar to other structures in India, this would not constitute a complete hospital in the western world. It lacked much of the advanced medical equipment of the West and was understaffed. I soon understood the close distance of the hospital.My grandfather worked there, largely for charity, which explained the rundown condition. Since it was mostly for charity, there were little spare funds to improve the hospital. Along with this work, my grandfather regularly donated to a local organization, greatly helping the community.Currently, India is improving. The economy is improving, while public works projects are used to increase employment and improve the cities. People are generally more positive about the future. I have come to understand that while India may still be underdeveloped, it is quickly catching up and isn’t so bad after all, while my grandfather showed me that kindness to strangers exists in India.
