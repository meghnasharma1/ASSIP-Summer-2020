All of the pairs in the chemistry lab turn their attention to their individual diffraction grating, and as the lights turn off in the room, we see the bright violet, teal, and red colored lines on the spectral gas tube through the diffraction grating. The students in the class exclaim in wonder, and as we take measurements, some groups finish early, switching sides and looking at the line spectrum of the other element, whether neon or hydrogen. The colors are predictable, spaced apart predictably, and provide valuable information to help us learn about spectral series brought about by the jumps by electrons between energy levels, or orbitals. The same ideas that were used in this lab are used by scientists around the world in an effort to observe the stars, galaxies, and other astronomical objects in a process called astronomical spectroscopy.	When used in observing the sun, astronomical spectroscopy is used to figure out the chemical composition and temperature of the sun and identify fluctuations in solar activity, such as coronal mass ejections, along with solar flares. Coronal mass ejections are known to cause disturbances in radio communication and other technology on earth due to their output of magnetic plasma interfering with human technology (Oliveira & Samsonov, 2018). However, what is not as well known is the effect of solar activity on terrestrial weather. According to a variety of sources, the solar wind can cause an intensification of natural disasters, such as tropical cyclones and earthquakes, potentially costing human lives. Solar activity fluctuates with a period of approximately 11 years between consecutives maxima, affecting long term climate on the order of centuries and short term weather with a scale of days (Walton, 2018). However, limited research has been conducted on intermediate effects of fluctuations in solar activity.	Koval, Gavrilov, Pogoreltsev, and Shevchuk (2018) found that solar activity influenced the spread of planetary waves, which are large disruptions to the atmosphere, to the thermosphere. This can affect atmospheric circulation, and thus, affect weather. Koval et. al used atmospheric modeling concentrated in the middle and upper atmosphere at a height of about 300 km in order to find a statistically significant correlation between high solar activities and eastward wind velocity. They also found that planetary wave amplitude decreased with high solar activity at most latitudes. This is due to the energy transfer between layers of the atmosphere, especially between the thermosphere. The energy transfer is strongest at specific latitudes dependent on the time of the year.Zherebtsov, Kovalenko, Molodykh, and Kirichenko (2019) constructed a model for the effect solar activity has on climate. In this model, they included the effect solar activity has on atmospheric and oceanic temperatures. Zherebtsov et al. found a correlation between climate and solar activity, using records and estimates for a time span of 1000 years. Like Koval et al, a correlation between high solar activities and high wind speed was found. Zherebtsov et al. explain that solar activity causes a change in the electric potential of the ionosphere due to convection and particles from the magnetosphere. This leads to cloud formation because the water vapor condenses. Through this, the balance of radiation changes and Earth’s climate system changes. Although single events will negligibly affect Earth’s climate, Earth’s climate will be affected over long periods of time on the order of centuries.The main finding of Prikryl, Nikitina, and Rušin (2019) was that rapid intensification of tropical storms tended to come after high speed solar wind or coronal mass ejections, a release of magnetized plasma from the solar corona. This is because the magnetized plasma generates atmospheric gravity waves, which can trigger atmospheric instabilities. This in turn is linked to tropical cyclone intensification, seen by the formation of a second eyewall, a location with the most rain and fastest wind in a cyclone, through convective bursts. Prikryl et al. explained that the last step of this process was through a release of heat, giving energy to the tropical cyclone and intensifying it. I emailed Professor Prikryl about the reliability of using their results in real world applications to predict tropical cyclone intensification, and he replied that it is too early to use his results or other results in the field, as it is too early to answer those questions (P. Prikryl, personal communication, February 4, 2019). He also said that the field of research is still expanding and future research will have to be conducted in order to construct stronger models.The research conducted on this topic has the potential to change long-term and short-term weather forecasting worldwide. Once further research is conducted, and more data analyzed, a complete model of the change in long-term climate brought about by solar activity could be created. Research conducted could help predict certain aspects of natural disasters, such as when they intensify, and help save lives. Further research should focus on analyzing other factors in an effort to construct more sophisticated and accurate models. Further research should also focus on addressing other natural disasters to see whether solar activity has an effect on earthquakes, tornadoes, or floods, to list a few.The various models created by the mentioned researchers, such as the one linking solar activity to tropical cyclone intensification, may not be significant individually. However, if combined with future research, a stronger model capable of predicting natural disasters or when they intensify could be created. Utilizing these models in order to potentially save lives would mitigate the cost, financial and human, of these disasters.
