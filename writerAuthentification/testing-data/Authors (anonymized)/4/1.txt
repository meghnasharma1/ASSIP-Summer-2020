The room suddenly went dark as the lights were turned off for the lab. I hit the power button on the tube and watched as it suddenly began to glow. My partner carefully placed the diffraction grating, which would split apart the light, on top of the stand. I peered through the grating into the light. Six lines appeared, with two lines each for every color: red, teal, and violet. I knew these colors were unique to the gas in the tube, hydrogen. This process, called emission spectroscopy, is used for identifying elements of an unknown substance. It wouldn’t be until a couple months later when I would realize how I could apply it to one of the most widespread medical conditions in the world.Diabetes is the most common type of lifestyle diseases. In today’s world, almost half a billion people are diagnosed with diabetes. This study will focus on type II diabetes, which includes more than 90% of all diabetes cases. It is caused by the body being unable to produce insulin properly. Identifying blood glucose levels provides information about the progression of the disease (Numako 2018). The usual method of blood collection, through a needle in superficial arm veins, is invasive and increases the risk of infection. Emission spectroscopy is a cost-efficient noninvasive way to detect and analyze blood samples for various substances, such as glucose, hemoglobin, insulin, or treatment drugs.Currently, one non-invasive method that is being used to analyze body fluid samples is mass spectrometry. This process involves an apparatus, which ionizes molecules and uses the mass-to-size ratio to identify the chemical. Mass spectrometry is often used in chemical analyses, as it can be applied to pure samples or complex mixtures. While there are several mediums through which mass spectrometry, or any other non invasive method, can be conducted, one of the more simpler methods is through a dried saliva spot (DSS) sampling. The saliva sampling is easy, noninvasive, painless and stress free. In this method, saliva is collected on filter paper and combined with an organic solvent. This increases the allows for easy extraction, sampling, and storage (Numako, 2018). Mass Spectrometry is used in conjunction with DSS sampling to determine insulin ratios of healthy, pre-diabetic, and diabetic patients. However, in order to acquire an accurate reading, this method requires a expensive machine called a tandem mass spectrometry apparatus. Researchers have found that even liquid chromatography with fluorescence is recommended over a mass spectrometry analysis.There are several types of spectroscopy that have been proven to be efficient when analyzing samples for certain molecules. The two major variations used for blood or saliva-based samples are Near-Infrared(NIR) Spectroscopy and Raman Spectroscopy. In this current day, there is not technique that has proven to be without limitations, or included in a “gold standard” protocol for analysis. However, Raman spectroscopy comes close. It is a non-destructive method that is based on the scattering of monochromatic light, providing information about a substance’s chemical content (Roman, 2019). It has the capability to identify substances in the blood from the spectrum of just a single red blood cell. It is being used in clinical applications for monitoring diabetes, as it can specifically detect hemoglobin and HbA1c, which is hemoglobin bonded to glucose, which are important biomarkers. The other type of spectroscopy, NIR spectroscopy, does not involve visible light. Several different types of radiation can be used in emission spectroscopy, each one with unique properties. However, near-infrared radiation is the most efficient for analyzing body fluids. UV radiation is absorbed by DNA and proteins, visible light by hemoglobins, and infrared radiation by water (Sakudo, 2016). Unlike these forms of radiation, near-infrared radiation is very minimally absorbed by water and hemoglobin, and has less scatter. NIR spectroscopy is usually done with wavelengths in the range 650-1100 nm, which is also called the “optical window”. There are several biomarkers which indicate the prevalence of diabetes of pre-diabetes within a person. Biomarkers are unique signs that can be used to diagnose a patient with diabetes. When using spectroscopy as a sampling mechanism, certain biomarkers have to be watched for, for they can provide key information. One such biomarker is the presence of extracellular vesicles in urine. The extracellular vesicles can be separated through centrifugation methods and the significance of the vesicles can be analyzed through Raman spectroscopy (Roman, 2019). An analysis of clusters of extracellular vesicles through Raman spectroscopy can differentiate cells based on various glycemic conditions, also allowing for a distinction between diabetes and pre-diabetes patients. This is important, as pre-diabetes is the only stage of the disease which is reversible (Yang, 2019). Another effective biomarker is AMP(Adenosine Monophosphate)-activated protein kinase (AMPK). It is known to be suppressed in diabetes patients, due to a high ATP/AMP ratio, which indicates a substantial increase in the rate of glycolysis, the first step in converting glucose to ATP (Miyamoto, 2016). Mass spectrometry and spectroscopy have been used to identify diabetic kidneys, by a significant increase in ATP/AMP ratio in the glomerulus, the part of the kidney that filters the blood. An email inquiry has been sent to Dr. Miyamoto concerning how exactly these processes were used to identify an ATP/AMP ratio.This research topic is important because the rate of people being diagnosed with diabetes, pre-diabetes, and renal diseases is increasing worldwide. It is crucial to find new methods to be able to identify and diagnose diabetes early on. When diabetes is allowed to extend for a long period of time, symptoms caused by other diseases and conditions can cause complexities. Using spectroscopy to analyze blood provides also several key advantages, especially because it is a completely non-invasive method. This not only reduces the chance of the patient developing an infection, but also the chance that external agents will affect the blood sample.From being used to teach chemistry lessons to identifying signs of diabetes, emission spectroscopy is a tool that has a plethora of uses. Expanding its popularity in the scientific community may result in many new outbreaks and discoveries. Identifying the elements in an unknown substance is a versatile skill that can be used by scientists of any field. Also, it is relatively cheap compared to current practices, such as mass spectrometry. These advantages make emission spectroscopy an ideal tool in the future of medical science.
