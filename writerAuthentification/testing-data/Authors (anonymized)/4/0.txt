My mind was racing. I was going on my first camping trip! I had my camping backpack, with clothes for two days, bug spray, flashlight, pocket knife, and my first-aid kit. My Boy Scout troop was going to a campsite in the Blue Ridge Mountains called Sky Meadows. When I was leaving, my mom was shouting off essentials that I should have packed for our camping trip but may have forgotten. When all the equipment that the other scouts I was carpooling with and I brought was stuffed in the trunk and we were finally loaded in, the back our luggage was stacked so high that we couldn’t see the rear window. It included: tents, sleeping bags, and all the necessities needed for a successful camping trip. We were finally on our way.  An hour’s drive later, we were in the Blue Ridge mountains. As we drove up steep hills, I could see nothing but farmland and intermittent patches of castles of rich green woodland that reached crept between the endless fields of corn and other vegetation. We arrived at the sight and had to hike a couple miles from the lone parking lot to get to the campsite. This is when calamity struck for the first time that night.An hour into the hike, it was pitch black. The foggy darkness was only pierced by the narrow pinpricks of our flashlights. In front of us, so small we almost walked right past it, was a sign, showing two paths to different campsites. One path went straight through the path we were currently on, and the other snaked its way up a steep, curved incline. The advanced scout who was leading us, Mark, paused only for a moment before confidently turning onto the incline path with a motion that we should follow him. At this point, I was berating myself for bringing as many supplies as I did, as my backpack began to feel like a dead weight. We all walked down that narrow road, as a train of lights walking in a single file row. After a half-hour on the route, Mark peered at his map and said, “I think we may have gone the wrong way, we should have arrived by now.” As he turned back down the hill, we all followed like mindless minions, so exhausted not even one us had the energy to harangue him about his blunder.After what felt like another hour, it might have been longer or shorter as I didn’t have a cell-phone to check the time, we stood in between a patch of campsites. We had found it, campsite number thirty-two, our home for that night. After a little evaluating of the flatness of the ground, the fire pit, and the accessibility of the port-a-potties, we started to unpack all our things and equipment. It took a little while, but after we had wrestled with the tents and made a trek to the port-a-potties, we all plopped down and caught our breath. The rest didn’t last long though, we had to gather wood, build a fire, and make dinner before it got too dark. I went with some scouts to grab water from a nearby pump to cook the pasta we had brought along. After we placed the water in pans on top of the camping stoves, one of the other scouts went to grab the gasoline. He returned with one canister. He returned with one nearly empty canister. Mark, who had been in this kind of situation before knew what to do. We built a contraption with some wood sticks to hold the pans over the fire. The night was freezing and air chilly enough for our breaths to be seen. We all huddled around the fire for more than an hour waiting for the water to boil. We finally ate dinner two-and-a-half hours after we “started cooking”. We cleaned our eating plates and hit the sleeping beds.Or, we were going to. Some of the scouts said that they didn’t bring tents to sleep in. We all got out and redistributed ourselves among the tents, so everyone had a space to sleep. I had a clear view of the night sky through the open meshing of the tent I was in. I laid with four other scouts, packed like sardines, in a tent mad for three. I watched the only constellation I knew, Orion. That night, as I laid squished with four other snoring scouts, I watched Orion’s entire journey through the vast idyllic night sky.The next morning, breakfast was the same routine as what we had done to prepare dinner. The air smelled of smoldering fire. It wasn’t long until we had packed everything up and moved on to the next hike. Fortunately, the rest of the trip wasn’t full of as many mishaps as that night.As the car pulled into the driveway of my home, I struck by an epiphany. All the errors that occurred on my first night of camping were due to a lack of preparation. The map wasn’t read beforehand. Fuel for the stoves wasn’t checked. Enough tents weren’t brought. I was amazed by the irony of the situation; one of the first rules that Boy Scouts are taught is the Boy Scout motto,Be prepared.
