It was just another day in Chemistry. The morning announcements played and our teacher excitedly gave us the instructions for our new lab on intermolecular forces. At first, confusion struck my mind when she told us to dip Vernier probes into beakers of methanol and ethanol. We quickly took them out and let them dry as the probes recorded the temperature of their respective alcohols. What did this have to do with intermolecular forces? For 3 minutes, our computer collected data from the probe and crafted an elaborate line graph. Curious to see how everything tied together, I sat back down at my table to hear our teachers discourse explain everything. It turns out, as the alcohols dried and evaporated off the probes, it removed heat from them and decreased the temperature. If we looked at how fast the temperature decreased, we could see how rapidly the alcohols evaporated. From the graph, we knew ethanol had evaporated faster than methanol, but why? Finally, it all hit me. My initial confusion shifted into a deeper understanding of intermolecular forces. Intermolecular forces, known as IMFs, are attractive forces between molecules, holding them together. Dispersion is the weakest IMF and occurs when electrons in an atom, which are constantly moving, suddenly occupy a position where they become unevenly distributed within the atom. When electrons are unevenly shared, molecules gain partial charges, becoming negatively charged on one end and positively charged on the other. Since opposites attract, the negative side of one molecule will attract to the positive side of another molecule and vice versa. This force brings molecules together. Ethanol molecules are bigger than methanol, so they have stronger dispersion forces. Larger molecules give more space and freedom for electrons to move. Since ethanol has stronger dispersion, the molecules are held together stronger. In evaporation, molecules need to separate from each other, so ethanol would evaporate slower since it would be harder to take molecules apart. I finally understood the power of intermolecular forces and how they can keep molecules together. The way molecules are held together can profoundly impact the characteristics of many substances. I wondered how intermolecular forces could determine traits other than evaporation rates, such as viscosity, a significant characteristic of liquids. 	It is no doubt liquids are some of the most important substances in our world. 71% of Earth is covered by water, which keeps us alive. Liquids like oil have a myriad of applications in energy, vehicles, construction, and more. When using liquids for a specific purpose, it’s important to know how they behave and what traits they have. Viscosity is an important characteristic of liquids, describing their resistance to move. Water has a relatively low viscosity and can flow easily. We know syrup has a very high viscosity since it moves slowly. Viscosity has different applications in society, such as oils. It determines how oils flow, affecting the rate of oil consumption and startup performances of oil-run machines ("The Importance of an Oil’s Viscosity," n.d.). However, viscosity is especially important in the growing field of liquid-based electronics, where liquid electrolytes are used in power sources. Scientists around the world are researching how viscosity works and what factors affect it. In it all, intermolecular forces play a key role in determining viscosity, affecting all of its applications. A better understanding of viscosity can lead to a better understanding of how to advance liquid-based electronics.	Back in 2017, a team of scientists at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory wanted to investigate how water molecules move, giving them a look into the origins of viscosity and how it works at the molecular level (Iwashita et al., 2017). While the structure of water molecules is clear, their way of moving isn’t. Iwashita et. al (2017) developed a technique known as inelastic X-ray scattering to observe the dynamics of water molecules in real space and time. The X-ray scattering helped them measure hydrogen bonds between water (Iwashita et al., 2017). Hydrogen bonds are the strongest intermolecular force, determining viscosity and how the molecules move. When observing the water, if a hydrogen bond broke in a molecule, a neighboring molecule would move closer to that molecule and form another bond, supporting the transport and movement of molecules (Iwashita et al., 2017). They also found viscosity is determined by the time it takes for molecules to move past each other (Iwashita et al., 2017). In conclusion, inelastic X-ray scattering proved to be effective (Iwashita et al., 2017). I spoke with Takeshi Egami, one of the scientists on the team. T. Egami (personal communication, February 6, 2019) stated in order to modify the viscosity of liquids for their different applications, it’s important to understand the mechanism, which is what they researched. From this knowledge, scientists can improve liquid transport, lubrication, and decrease energy loss within systems such as pipelines, which use oil for energy (T. Egami, personal communication, February 6, 2019).When understanding the inner workings of viscosity, the next step is to know how to modify the viscosity of liquids for their specific applications. Intermolecular forces play a key role in this. In 2019, five scientists from Beijing researched how hydrogen bonding affects the viscosity of water (Fang et al., 2019). Hydrogen bonding occurs when the positive hydrogen atom of one molecule is attracted to the very electronegative atoms of another. The electronegativity of an atom describes that atom’s ability to attract electrons. Fang et al. (2019) looked into the relationship between hydrogen bonding and viscosity in liquids such as water, methanol, ethanol, and ether. We actually used methanol and ethanol in our IMF lab. They compared the viscosity levels between water and ether, measured by the units, mPa s. Water, with hydrogen bonding, had a viscosity of 1 mPa s, higher than ether’s viscosity of 0.233 mPa s (Fang et al., 2019). Ether doesn’t have hydrogen bonding. From this data, they found hydrogen bonding has a direct, positive relationship with viscosity (Fang et al., 2019). As water molecules move, hydrogen bonds form and break, influencing viscosity (Fang et al., 2019). Stronger hydrogen bonds are harder to break and therefore, it’s harder for water to flow. Furthermore, temperature is another factor in viscosity, but its effect becomes more prominent with higher temperatures. High temperatures were observed to reduce the lifetime of hydrogen bonds, meaning they could break easier and consequently, the liquid could flow easier (Fang et al., 2019). As temperature increases, viscosity decreases. Overall, the intermolecular forces of hydrogen bonding and temperature are factors to consider when using liquids or modifying the viscosity of liquids. So far, temperature, pressure, and intermolecular forces are the only discovered factors of viscosity, determining how liquids can be transported (Ni, Fang, Yu, & Fan, 2019). However, these parameters were found to affect only static liquids. It is possible more factors other than these exist within flowing liquids. In 2019, a team of 4 scientists from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China researched the relationship between viscosity and another factor, the velocity of flowing water (Ni et al., 2019). In order to see how viscosity was affected, they needed to gain information on the hydrogen bond structures, the dominant force behind viscosity (Ni et al., 2019). They used a method known as infrared spectroscopy to probe and measure the structure of the hydrogen bonds. In their experiment, water flowed through a pipe into a beaker, passing through an absorption cell they designed to analyze the molecular structure of the water flowing through (Ni et al., 2019). They performed different trials with 3 different levels of temperature and flow velocity. Ni et al. (2019) found viscosity decreased as temperature increased, falling in line with the previous study’s findings from the last paragraph (Fang et al., 2019). As velocity increased, it affected the hydrogen bonding by making it more structured and packed together (Ni et al., 2019). Therefore, viscosity also increased. At lower temperatures, the differences in viscosity between different levels of velocity were more significant (Ni et al., 2019). In conclusion, Ni et al. (2019) discovered a positive relationship between velocity and viscosity and further proved the negative relationship between temperature and viscosity. Due to research in recent years, the scientific community now has a deeper, clearer, and more concrete understanding of how viscosity works, how intermolecular forces affect it, and how other factors such as velocity and temperature come into play. This information all takes significance in the applications of liquids, as viscosity is a fundamental property of them. As mentioned previously, a prominent field pertaining to liquids today is liquid-based electronics. According to T. Egami (personal communication, February 6, 2019), there is a dire situation affecting the entire electronics industry. Electrical devices like semiconductors need insulator films, thin layers that stabilize the electrical flow. Unfortunately, common insulator films such as silicon oxide are not insulating properly at the nano-scale, their capabilities limited (T. Egami, personal communication, February 6, 2019). In the field of liquid-based electronics, scientists advocate for the use of liquid electrolytes instead, which can be used in computer chips and batteries (T. Egami, personal communication, February 6, 2019). Overall, this field is essential for the sake of all electronics. Understanding viscosity on a molecular level can help scientists characterize candidates for liquid electrolytes (Iwashita et al., 2017). They can sort them and judge their effectiveness by their viscosity and molecular structure, knowing which liquids to use and which ones to not. As of now, researchers of the field are developing liquid electrolytes they can use to improve electronics. Very recently on February 5, 2019, a team of scientists from Sydney’s University of Technology created an ionic liquid called IL-TEMPO to boost the performance of rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries (Zhang et al., 2019). Their liquid was able to increase the battery cycle life, protect it from corrosion, and improve charge efficiency (Zhang et al., 2019). This growing field continues to grow today, advancing towards a brighter future for electronics. 	It turns out intermolecular forces had a far greater significance than I thought. In the lab, I learned how it affects evaporation rates. Curious to see how it affected other physical properties, I researched its relationship with viscosity. In my research, I learned how intermolecular forces play a role in the entire electronics industry, with viscosity being the connecting link between them. The lab didn’t just teach me about a force that could affect evaporation rates. It introduced me to a new, simple concept of chemistry that had a much greater impact on substances we use in daily life. Concerning the field of liquid-based electronics, I’m curious to see what new advancements scientists will make in the electronic industry, applying new knowledge of viscosity. How will the performance and efficiency of our daily electronics improve? Whatever modifications or improvements are made, intermolecular forces will lie deep behind the scenes.
