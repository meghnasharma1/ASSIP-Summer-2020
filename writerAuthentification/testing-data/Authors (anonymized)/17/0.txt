As soon as the minute hand on the clock struck 8, I knew it was over. There was no more time left. It was 8:40 AM and she was already handing out my doom and downfall, which my teacher called the Algebra 2 Unit 4 test. That overwhelmingly nerve-wracking period of studying on the bus without a minute to spare was over. In what seemed like the shortest hour of my life from 7:40 AM to 8:40 AM, I garnered all the knowledge about radicals and rational numbers I possibly could. As the test paper settled onto my desk, my heart skipped a beat. Picking up the pencil marked the beginning of an hour that would evaporate faster than the previous one. At 10:15 AM, dropping the paper into the bin felt like skydiving, not knowing if the parachute would work. Too late to get back on the helicopter I just jumped from, I would have to wait and see what happens. It could be a victorious experience or an utter disaster.	I went splat on the ground. Looking at my online report card a week later was a harrowing sight. Who knew a simple letter could eradicate all feelings of hope and self-confidence? I questioned reality as I scrutinized the first F I had ever seen. It seemed like the value of Jordan Lee on the human stock market plunged down into a bottomless pit. Looking in the mirror, I found the only person responsible for this devastating loss. Me. Maybe I didn’t study enough. I definitely wasn’t smart enough. Gazing at my reflection, I looked at a failure. A let down not only to himself but also his family. No matter what compliment anyone could give me, whether they say I’m smart or talented, my grades certainly didn’t show for it. This is only one of the myriad of examples where I slipped and fell into a pit of shame. I wasn’t enough. Was this who I was? Good for nothing? Unable to measure up?Of course I had my successes, but failures seemed to come and cancel them out. An A on the Unit 1 test but a C on Unit 2. A Monday devoid of procrastination but a Tuesday I spent binge watching YouTube. 300 likes on an Instagram post but 100 on the next. 	Was this who I was? An aggregate of every high and every low?	These questions keep repeating in my head like a broken record. An internal battle rages within me. Self-contentment pitted against shame and guilt, clashing neck and neck. The calamity in my head seems to blind me from the truth. In the midst of this avalanche of emotions, it is buried under the crushing weight of self-condemnation. While church says I’m a masterpiece made in God’s image, the big fat F glaring at me says I’m nothing but a failure. While my parents tell me that I am loved and treasured, the number of Instagram followers tell me I’m insignificant. Who am I?  I am not perfect. Who is? However, if I just look at my failures, I will always seem hopeless. Just looking at the times I slipped up, I’ll feel like the worst person in the world. Just looking at my flaws, I’m missing out on the rest of the story: the good parts. It’s like falling asleep when the final battle of a Marvel movie starts. However, if I stay awake, here’s what I’ll see. A C on a Unit 2 test but an A on Unit 3. A Tuesday spent binge watching YouTube but a Wednesday where I exterminated the pest called instant gratification. Less than 100 likes on an Instagram post but a small group of friends that genuinely care about me. While the setbacks in my life always seem to drag down my worth, my life is also full of blessings that can’t be denied.	Was this who I was? Something more than a failure? Achievements or the lack thereof can’t define me properly. One day, I would see myself as the elected Class President of 2021. The next, I’ll just be the kid that bombed his history project. Looking the mirror, my reflection is fogged up and distorted. Where is the elixir that will bring armistice between the armies of penitence and self-confidence? I know I have failed my parents and even my closest friends. We’ve had those Disney-like moments where the main character and their confidant argue and part ways, which usually happens near the climax. Yet, there’s always that last scene where the confidant comes to rescue the protagonist at the last minute. They haven’t given up on each other. I guess my life is like a Disney movie too. The friends I’ve let down in the past are still my friends in the present. The parents I would drive up the wall still say they love me every day. When it seemed like my relationship with them was shattered in moments of failure, love never faltered. There was forgiveness and reconciliation. Every time. 	The broken record continues to repeat itself over and over again. Am I a good enough student? Am I a good enough son? Am I a good enough friend? There’s got to be an instruction manual somewhere to fix this thing. Searching, I found it in my family. Their love and acceptance stretch beyond the boundary of logic. They forgive. They support. They accept me like an iPhone 4S with a shattered screen, treating it like an iPhone X. Why? Definitely not because I deserve it. It’s because I am their child, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Lee. I am too precious to ever be thrown out and replaced. That’s against the nature of family. In every triumph and every defeat, their love remains constant.	Was this who I was? Unconditionally loved despite my missteps and blemishes?	After much troubleshooting, the record player finally ceases for just a moment. The warring soldiers halt, putting their weapons down. The wildcard steps into the battle field, descending down into the dead center of no man’s land. It’s called Love and it satisfies both armies, the compromise needed to achieve peace. If pull off a triumphant feat, I’m loved. If I blunder terribly, I’m still loved. The shrouding fog on the mirror begins to dissipate. I see my true reflection in its purest form. In the serene silence, I gaze at a boy who is loved no matter what happens. 	This is who I am. Beloved. Accepted.  Enough.
