Ms. Anna placed a white vase next to a lantern on the rose pink cloth. Using a flat brush, my thirteen year old self started applying the underlayer of paint onto the untouched canvas. This was the beginning of a new painting. 	Ever since 6th grade, when my mother started sending me to art classes, my instructors have told me I had a knack for art. I was put into higher and higher leveled classes, which would've taken years for normal students to do. I’d complete piece after piece each month and many were proudly displayed in the art school gallery. My soft-spoken self-confidence was built up every week as I looked forward to bringing a pencil up to a still life sketch, creating a watercolor painting of a car, or shading an ink drawing of a city. Each was the beginning of a new drawing.My teachers were all very supportive of my efforts. Sometimes they let me try out my own style of drawing or painting and would give advice on techniques to improve. However, starting from 7th grade, each time I brought a finished piece to present to my mother, I was greeted with a wave of criticism flowing from her mouth. A thunderstorm of needles poured onto me as I tried to drown out the negative comments.“This texture on the wing looks horrible! What were you thinking? Do feathers look like that? I have never seen such a fat ugly bird! I didn’t pay all this money for you to fail!”To placate her fiery temper, I quickly put away the drawing and muttered “I’ll redo it”, hiding away the naive self-confidence that took a harsh blow. Like any other Asian mother, mine had high expectations for whatever I did. I had to show improvement and effort or come out on top to satisfy her; otherwise, I would be faced with harsh criticism. Each time I would try to be sanguine and continue on other projects, but as someone who used to study graphic design, my mother continued to berate me on works. I felt like my self-esteem drop lower and lower into a pitch black abyss until a bright opening approached me when I started acrylic. After drawing and designing a Google Doodle, Ms. Anna, my instructor at the time, thought I was ready to paint on canvas. Acrylic was a new start for me. It was a medium that could be layered, covered, changed to the way I wanted. The still life Ms. Anna set up for me gleamed with new hopes of experimentation with acrylic. The dark wine bottle, the white vases and flowers, and the magenta cloth were awaiting my attempts at immortalizing the scene on canvas in my interpretation. My confidence and enthusiasm were blooming like a daisy after the first spring shower. This was the beginning of a new painting.For seven weeks, I worked on this project. Seven weeks of examining the model for minuscule details I missed in previous classes. Seven weeks of tweaking the color and contrast of the objects. My mother was irritated with how slow I was progressing, I was conflicted on what techniques I should use to paint, and my eagerness dropped each time I walked into the classroom. The impending presentation of the project to my mother rankled in my mind with every brushstroke. One day, Ms. Anna was absent. The substitute was a solemn looking man, probably in his forties. His presence intimidated me as he patrolled the classroom, peering over each student’s shoulder to give criticism on their work. His composure reminded me of my mother has he made harsh remarks to some misfortuned students. Suddenly, I hear his voice next to my ear. “You need more contrast. Get up, let me show you something.”A shiver ran down my spine as I slowly got out of my chair and handed over my paintbrush, still dripping wet from the fresh white paint I applied. He washed the brush and mixed blue, red, and white, creating a deep, dark, violet-gray tone. I watched the sincere man placed delicate strokes on my canvas, applying the paint to create the darkest part of the shadow of a fabric fold. The fear of being reprimanded subsided as each correction he made stirred an inspiration in me on how I should apply my paint for the best colors and contrasts.Getting up from my seat, the substitute teacher continued to give me advice, showing me how to use paints of opposite temperatures to create complex appearances, and demonstrating the best way to create distinct strokes for the reflection of metals. All these words I took to heart and kept in mind while completing the project. A few weeks later, I showed the painting to my mother, who finally praised me on my work. The proud feeling in my chest pushed me towards filling a few more canvases with my interpretations of different subjects, ranging from landscapes to houses. For once, when my mother saw my work, she did not let out a stream of criticism. Instead, she pointed out many parts in my paintings she particularly liked. A few years later, I quit art classes. As I came across digital paintings of animals, cityscapes, and abstract works, I began to create artwork in this new medium. With a stylus in hand, I took on this opportunity, painting digitally on virtual canvases. Instead of looking for validation from the people nearest to me, I created works that I’ve enjoyed drawing. Without an instructor, I improved by building on my own experience but never forgetting the advice my instructors gave me. I pulled up the images I was using as references. Using the pen tool, sixteen year old me sketched out the main parts of my landscape. I've realized that regardless of the medium, creating art will always serve as a way for me to express my thoughts and feelings, palliating the stress and conflicts in my life. This was the beginning of a new painting.
