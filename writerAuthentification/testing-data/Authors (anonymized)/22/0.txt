Our class watched intently as the teacher placed the cesium sample in front of the Geiger counter. Immediately, the stream of piercing beeps grabbed our attention; suddenly, it was silent. I looked up and saw a lead plate our teacher placed over the sample, blocking many of the radioactive particles. The beeps emitted by the Geiger counter signified the number of ionizing decayed particles, including gamma, alpha, and beta particles, detected by the machine. Later, we learned about how dense materials with large atomic structures can block α and β radioactive decays. The beeps were still running through my head when I heard a radio broadcast reporting on the death of a woman in Germany due to thyroid cancer from exposure to gamma radiation near power plants. I wondered why haven’t scientists developed shielding materials already to block gamma radiation. The issue of effective radiation shielding and attenuation for nuclear power plants is a problem researchers need to address to protect the wellbeing of the people and the environment around.	In over 31 nations, at least 450 nuclear reactors give millions of households energy. Many of the facilities already have protection methods using concrete, tellurite glasses, and heavy metals. However, unlike α and β particles which have charges or large masses, ionizing gamma and neutron radiation still can be penetrable and harmful to humans due to their light masses and neutral charges of the particles. Overexposure to radiation could result in thyroid cancer and miscarriages to humans. Besides being effective in radiation shielding, scientists are developing different concretes for maximum durability as well. This need was apparent in the Chernobyl power plant explosion since the reactors did not have appropriate concrete protection structures. This issue was brought up again after the 2011 Fukushima power plant meltdown after a tsunami in Japan. Although there are many concrete materials already developed, the effectiveness and durability is an area of improvement scientists are still working in.Starting with basics, scientists tested concrete of different densities on shielding and attenuation of gamma radiation. By experimenting with different types of concrete mixes, researchers concluded that steel-magnetite concrete, which had the highest density, had the most attenuation. According to R. Bagheri, (personal communication, February 9, 2019), attenuation of gamma rays relies on the density, elemental composition, photon energy, thickness, and geometry of the material. This was shown as the photon energies of the gamma rays generally decreased as the densities of the concrete increased. However, when the 316.51 keV photon was passed through the Barite concrete, the energy level dropped exceptionally in the half value and tenth value layers. This exception is because in barite concrete, elemental composition overcomes density effectiveness, and since the photoelectric effect is present in low energy regions, the attenuation of the gamma rays is substantially increased (Bagheri, Moghaddam, & Yousefi, 2016). Furthermore, the researchers deduced steel-magnetite’s effective atomic number is the greatest, and the effective electron density of the concretes is 2.83 x 1023 to 3.2 x 1023 electron/g.The density of different mixes of concrete can only do so much for shielding harmful radiation. Scientists further improved concrete shielding by changing the mixtures themselves with six different polymers which could improve the factors for radiation attenuation. Although all polymer concretes showed strong gamma and neutron radiation attenuation, barium polymer concrete was the best radiation absorber with a total neutron attenuation parameter at 2.935 x 10-3 (Seenappa, Manjunatha, Sridhar, & Hanumantharayappa, 2018). Since chlorine polymer concrete had the maxima for neutron scattering length and cross sections, it was the best radiation shielding material. Seenappa et. al. (2018) mentioned the photoelectric effect also mentioned in Bagheri et. al. (2016) and determined these concretes were most effective in lower energy levels. In addition, polymer concrete with up to 25% sulfur was observed to be a good sustainable thermoplastic material. Polymer concrete with up to 25% barium was observed to have good durability and sustainability against salts, acids, and other corrosive materials. Although polymer concretes seem promising, the durability and aggregability of polymer concretes is another issue scientists are addressing, especially elements which are used for neutron shielding. Boron is a relatively abundant metal that has a large cross section for neutron capture which makes the effective content in concrete to as low as 1% (Glinicki, Antolik, & Gawlicki, 2018). However, when boron compounds are mixed with ordinary Portland cement and calcium sulfoaluminate cement, the retardation factor of boron has a negative impact on the durability and effectiveness of the shielding concrete by the possibility of inconsistencies and cold joints during setting. Colemanite was observed to be the best boron bearing material which would not inhibit with the cement setting. However, the cements with colemanite and ulexite aggregates still were very fragile after setting or did not dry fully in a span of three days. Glinikcki et. al. (2018) discovered the solution to this problem would be nanosilica which could accelerate the hydration process in concretes with a content of only 1-2% of cement weight.Radiation shielding is still a field of research scientists are doing today. With the more recent fusion developments at hand, materials that can withstand intense conditions while still providing protection to humans is a necessity for these plants. Gimenez and Lopasso (2018) found in small and medium reactors, the usage of tungsten carbide was very effective in moderating fast neutron flux. However, the high price is a setback to this material. Gimenez et. al. detailed a plan to incorporate absorbing rods in the structure so less tungsten carbide was used but the effectiveness was not impeded. This development would be useful especially for high-frequency radiation and in fusion reactors. In addition, recently the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor planned the usage of steel alloys by the NRG in plates for heat resistance and neutron shielding ("NRG Irradiates," 2019). These plates will be used primarily for fusion research due to its durability and compatibility with ceramics and metals. As nuclear energy becomes more universal, shielding materials are necessary for the safety of the humans and the environment around.As I gaze upon the Geiger counter each time I walk into chemistry class, the beeps echoing in my head remind me of the time where I was shown how radiation can be blocked. Nuclear power is revolutionizing the world as more energy can be created from efficient fuel sources, but the radiation problems push researchers to make precautions for the protection of humans around. With commercial fusion reactors being a near future aspiration, concretes and shielding materials would be even more important for the success of bringing energy safely to people all around the world. Experimenting with compounds, polymers, and aggregates will not only strengthen the bonds between us and harnessing nuclear energy, but could open new doors in research towards the growing nuclear age.
