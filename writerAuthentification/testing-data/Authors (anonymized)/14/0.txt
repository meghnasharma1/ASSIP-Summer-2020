“Good afternoon class!  Please clear off your desk and get out a pen or pencil.”  It was only after I had run across the building that I heard this phrase, feared by so many.  It is this phrase that is so often used to doom students to weekends filled with nothing but chores, misery and the inevitable grounding.  After my teacher spoke, I got the feeling that a family of frogs had just taken up residence in my throat and stomach.  I knew what she was about to make us do and I also knew that it meant one more failed attempt to succeed at something that was unattainable—at least a 95% on a Math 4 Unit Test.	As she began to explain what this horrible test would entail, I began to reminisce on past math class experiences.  What came to mind was how I had always enjoyed math and had even planned on taking every single possible math class in high school. My mind then wandered to all the pleasant teachers I used to have and how much I used to look forward to coming to class.  Oh, I longed for the days when I used to write and understand math with ease and grace.  I wished for those times when all of my assessments—tests or quizzes—would be returned with A’s.  Those, indeed, were the days!When my teacher laid that evil piece of paper on my desk, I was jerked back to reality.  As I sat in a somewhat tumultuous staring contest with that thing, I began to loath the entire class and everything that it stood for.  However, as time progressed, complete and utter despair washed over me.  I had been trying so hard on these tests with very minimal results.  It was so disappointing and frustrating to try to persistently just to find that my best wasn’t good enough.   Even my most valiant efforts still didn’t produce the results I wanted so badly. What can I do if math isn’t my strength anymore? As a member of typical family of Indian heritage, it’s absurd to say I am not doing well in math. I can continue to tell my parents and peers that math is my strength, but subconsciously I’d just consider myself a charlatan.After pondering all this for some time, I realized I had never experienced this terrible, helpless feeling. I was in a state of deep angst. Previously, school had always been an easy thing for me and I never struggled for any of the grades I received.  However, it now occurred to me that school required hard work.  Working at these mind-bending questions was the only to accomplish my ultimate goal—perfection.  So I worked through the quiz question by question and line by line.  That 3 page test, which I interpreted to be Chinese, took me the whole an hour and a half to complete.  Right as class was ending I turned it in with a renewed sense of hope.  When it was finally returned, I was awe-struck by the results.  After all my hard work, effort and thought, I saw the grade which I had earned—a solid 68 percent.“What? But I worked so hard on this! How can that be?” I screamed to myself.  I didn’t understand!  I mean, in every fable and rhyme I heard as a child, the message was always “Work hard to accomplish your goals.”  I sat there in disbelief for a while simply wondering over and over “Why?”  Why did I do so badly?  Why can’t I understand this?  I left class that day angry at myself, at the teacher, and again at that stupid practice test.  What was the point in taking it?  I had already done hours and hours of math review, and the final exam was quickly approaching.  I was running out of time and I made it worse by decreasing my grade by two percent! I mean, how is that going to help me on the final exam?	When I went home that day, I again thought about all those nursery rhymes, fables and catchy inspirational phrases that I had so often heard throughout my life.  After much time and consideration, I realized that striving for perfection was not and never would be realistic.  After recalling various memories in my life, it occurred to me that as long as I could remember, I wanted to be perfect.  I wanted the best grades, be involved in the best extra-curriculars and do the best things. Maybe this feeling came because of how much I looked up to my father. It seemed as if he succeeded every step of the way, coming from a small village in India and ending up in a successful state across the world. I now fathomed even he had trouble in his path, from coming to America with only a couple pairs of clothes, to changing jobs numerous times. After thinking about this I perceived I was never perfect and was never going to be perfect because there was no such thing. It didn’t matter that I had failed every single practice test because, I mean heck, the tests were a relatively small part of my math grade, much less my high school transcript.  What mattered was that I improved my score with my efforts.	This concept that perfection was unattainable also helped improve my quality of life because I wasn’t so obsessed about my grades and whether or not everyone thought I was a perfect person.  Instead of doing things to make myself look perfect or to impress others, I started to do things because I wanted to.  This improved my personal relationships because I became more relaxed and easy going.  I wasn’t competing with any of my friends to be the best.	Even though I never achieved that A on the test or a perfect personality, I gained so much more.  I attained a life filled with imperfections, strong character, and overall good grades.  Sure, it is not a blemish free existence, but I’ve grown to realize that it is the flaws in my life that make it ideal.  So I guess in a sense, I finally reached the perfection I had always wanted.
