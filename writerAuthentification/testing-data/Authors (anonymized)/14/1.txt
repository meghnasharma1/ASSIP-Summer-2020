It reminded me of elementary school, having the chance to play with legos and build what your heart desired. This time, however, I was not building a pirate ship or my dream house. I peered down at the MolyMod kit, filled with variously colored building blocks. Each building block represents an atom of a different element (e.g. carbon and oxygen). Right beside the blocks were small bridges that could be used to connect the blocks, signifying covalent bonds. Our teacher had just assigned us 20 molecules that we needed to model using the MolyMod kits. I learned how covalent bonding was prevalent in almost all molecules and how it contributed to the shape of these molecules. Covalent bonding is the type of bonding that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. Primarily found between nonmetals, the atoms have similar electronegativities, and neither displays a more dominant pull on the electrons. Thus, the atoms end up sharing the electrons. Covalent bonding plays an important role in all organisms, contributing to the structural integrity of all genetic material as it is the type of bond found between the sugar and phosphate molecules of the DNA backbone.DNA contains all of the genes, or basic hereditary units, that encode for the proteins that allow humans to function and grow. Any change in the sequence of DNA, even the alteration of a single nucleotide, can cause the cell to produce nonfunctional proteins that may alter how the body works. Cancer is simply uncontrolled cell proliferation. This means the cancerous cells multiply without restriction, often leading to the formation of tumors. A single mutation in the DNA could alter the genes that encode for proteins that control cell proliferation, causing the cell to turn cancerous. Currently, medical practitioners must conduct tissue biopsies, essentially surgical procedures, in order to find changes in DNA of cancer patients (Bernabe, Hickson, Wallace,  & Blackhall, 2017). However in the past few years, researchers around the world, specifically at UCSD and Hiroshima University, have discovered that dying cancerous cells discharge detectable fragments of DNA that circulate in the patient’s bloodstream, called ctDNA or circulating tumor DNA (Kato et al., 2017). Having access to these ctDNA fragments enables researchers to detect mutations from tumors and how each of them respond to treatment with different drugs, allowing researchers to potentially personalize treatment for the patient (Rostami & Bratman, 2017). After recognizing ctDNA as a useful asset in cancer treatment, researchers now obtain this information with a simple blood test, also called a liquid biopsy, without the patient having to go through a surgery (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2018). Liquid biopsies provide a less invasive, more efficient, and safer method for fighting cancer and creating patient-specific treatments. However, in December of 2017, researchers at the Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS decided to explore a new approach towards gaining information regarding ctDNA. The method used immunofluorescence staining and is based on a functionalized medical wire. This wire is an innovative device that permits the in vivo isolation of CTCs from a large volume of blood. The results obtained indicate that catching CTCs and analyzing their phenotype and chromosomal rearrangement could potentially represent a new companion diagnostic approach and provide an innovative strategy for improving personalized cancer treatments (Gallerani, Cocchi, Bocchini, Piccinini, & Fabri, 2017).As mentioned, liquid biopsy and other methods of ctDNA analysis are extremely beneficial to doctors. Around the same time as the scientists at IRCCS performed their research, a group of researchers at the Division of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Sciences detected ctDNA fragments in 46 cancer patients and common gene mutations among 25 samples. This allowed researchers to conclude that some mutations are found in all cancer patients. Roughly 83% of these mutations could be detected in the ctDNA, indicating the ctDNA’s mutations are representative of the tumor or cancerous tissue itself (Bernabe, Hickson, Wallace,  & Blackhall, 2017). The results of this study and others like it demonstrate the usefulness of ctDNA analysis and its applications for the future of medicine, as ctDNA analysis may give doctors a better idea as to which genes are altered in all cancer patients and how those genes respond to treatment.More recently, a group of scientists at the University of California, San Diego worked with ctDNA fragments. They were studying patients suffering from Carcinoma, a specific kind of epithelial tissue cancer. By analyzing ctDNA fragments, the researchers noticed that all cancer patients usually had alterations in the same genes and that 99.7 percent of patients exhibited potentially targetable alterations in his/her DNA (Kato et al., 2017). The study reflected that not all cancer patients had detectable ctDNA, as the amount of ctDNA that is detectable often depends on the size of the tumor and sensitivity of the test itself. Nonetheless, each patient has a unique genetic profile, indicating they react differently to treatments. The scientists’ results show that ctDNA analysis and noninvasive liquid biopsies can help match patients with previously FDA-approved treatments and are much more effective than their tissue biopsy counterpart. Every year, millions of individuals learn they have developed cancer, and many of those diagnosed pass away because of this disease. Developing more efficient ways of treating cancer patients, such as using the information gained by ctDNA analysis, will lower the number of deaths caused by cancer every year. Of course, liquid biopsy may not be limited to cancer, as there may be a number of other diseases associated with the blood and other bodily fluids (Khakoo, Georgiou, Gerlinger, Cunningham, & Starling, 2018). The implementation of ctDNA analysis into clinical practice is on the rise in order to combat the cancer deaths. Khakoo recognizes that “genotyping for treatment selection is likely to be the first application to be implemented into clinical practice” and one of the major challenges is the “standardization of the methods being used for ctDNA detection as well as the pre-analytical considerations” (Shelize Khakoo, personal communication, Feb. 4, 2019). Therefore ctDNA analysis in standard cancer checkups are expected to appear, however the process will take time.	It is clear that covalent bonding is prevalent to all organic matter on the planet and that it plays a vital role in all living organisms: contributing to the structural integrity of all genetic material. Through the connection to ctDNA analysis and liquid biopsy techniques, these technologies have proven significant in their implications for the future. By utilizing ctDNA and other biomarkers available in the body, researchers may be able to cure cancer with personalized treatment for all patients affected in the future.
