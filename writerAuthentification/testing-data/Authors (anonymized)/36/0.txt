I first became aware of identity before I was even three years old. I was among a group of adults when an old man, as old men are wont to do, asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. After thinking for a moment I, the blue-eyed blonde white boy with a southern drawl from my mother and Jewish surname from my father, emphatically responded: “I be...Italian.” The room erupted in laughter with me standing in the middle with a confused smile on my face. My family continues to tell this story for comedic effect, and it's obvious why. However, I have continuously thought of my answer. Can I be Italian? I could become an Italian citizen and learn to speak the language, but could I ever be truly Italian?  What I’ve come to realize from the inside of a bicultural household is that there are different elements of identity. A part of it is what you are: nationality, religion, race, sexuality, gender, generation and economic background. And just as the old man was asking me about career choices, many adults connect their identities to their professions. All of this ties into the more important who you are. This portion of identity is chosen individually through the choices I make and morals I choose to guide me. The final part of identity is the unwritten part, the choices to choose, experiences to undergo, and mistakes to be made.I’ve come to see my identity as a deck of cards, where some of my identifying traits fall into the “what” I am category. Their importance cannot be overlooked. They provide roots and ground me. When my Jewish grandfather fought in World War Two on the American side, he didn’t just fight for himself and his country. He fought for my unborn father, me, and all of his descendant's freedom. Through his service, he refined his own moral identity and helped shape my own.My mom is a garrulous southern Christian farm girl who’s handy with a rifle and my father is a quiet Jewish man from New York City who harbors a healthy suspicion of guns. If people just looked at the whats in my household it would seem rather dissonant. However, our house is pretty harmonious because my parents have shown me that while the whats make us interesting and individual, the moral identity of who we are helps determine our relationship with others.  My mother and my father disagree on a multitude of political issues. However, they encourage us to debate at the dinner table and even play devil’s advocate. The rule is that you can have any opinion you want as long as you can civilly and respectfully defend it. After hearing one parent speak about I would always feel certain that they were undoubtedly right. But after a few more minutes of debate, I would be hesitant to form an opinion. I still don’t know where I truly stand with most of these issues, but these debates taught me that there was never a completely right answer. To figure out the answer, or even realize that the proposed answer needs revision I need more than one lens.My parents also taught me to not fear failure, but to eschew making the same mistake multiple times. My parents know that a fear of failure limits me in my efforts and accomplishments. However, identity is a habit. Making the same mistake, again and again, allows it to become a part of me and limit me in another way. Through their disparate views, my parents have realized that understanding the world takes more than one viewpoint. To limit myself through fear and habits prevents me from not only understanding the world but my identity as well.Finally, I now know that I cannot control what I am, but I can change who I am. Just as I could not make myself Italian as a toddler, no one can control where, when, or in what circumstance they were born. However, who we are is controlled by our choices and our free will. Through consistently moral choices, by avoiding the same mistakes and fearlessly striving for success I can strengthen my own moral identity.Still, I am only 15. I don’t have a full identity yet. I have experiences to undergo, places to visit, failures to complete. I will need complex habits and ideas that I don’t have yet to help me with responsibilities, commitments, and roles that I will undoubtedly face. I hope to give my descendants the same sense of moral identity that was passed down to me. Along the way, I might even claim what I’ve created as my identity.
