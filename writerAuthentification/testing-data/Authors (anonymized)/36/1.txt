With the lights out and the door shut, the meager amount of light barely allowed me to see my hand right in front of my face. “Go ahead,” our chemistry teacher called out, “turn the power boxes on.” At that moment a low humming filled the classroom as little lines of light cut through the dark at every lab station. As I leaned down and squinted through the diffraction grating I saw three clean, clear, brightlycolored spectral lines where only darkness had been before. As I reached around and began measuring the red spectral line, it finally sunk in what I was looking at I was amazed to think this vibrant strip of light was actually made of energy ejected from hydrogen atoms. Although I didn’t know it at the time, ALPHA scientists in Switzerland were comparing the very same spectral lines I was measuring to the spectral lines of antihydrogen to test CPT invariance.Charge-parity-time (CPT) invariance is the principle which states our universe would follow the same laws of physics whether it was made of matter or antimatter (Gibney, 2017). This principle has been a cornerstone of physics since its inception and is the basis for numerous physics fields. If a violation of CPT invariance were found, it could label entire sections of physics unusable. In fact, researchers at the University of Valencia in Spain stated: “If found, CPT violation will threaten the very foundations of our understanding of nature” (Barenboim, Ternes, & Tórtola, 2018). While individual parts of CPT invariance have been disproven, CPT invariance as a whole has never been disproven, allowing physics to continue without problem. The comparison of antihydrogen and hydrogen emission spectrums, the energy spectrums produced when electrons go to a lower energy level and release energy in the form of light, is so vital to physics because it shows if CPT invariance is indeed correct or not. T. Momose (personal communication, February 5, 2019) told me, if the emission spectrums of antihydrogen and hydrogen differ at any level, we would know CPT invariance fails at that level. This would force a reevaluation of the massive amount of physics which depends on CPT invariance.In 2017 the ALPHA team of scientists working at CERN invented the ALPHA-2 machine (Ahmadi et al., 2017). Before the creation of the ALPHA-2,  the original ALPHA machine could create 25,000 antihydrogen atoms, but could only measure approximately 14 atoms of the antihydrogen atoms per trial (Cho, 2016). The dismally small ratio of measured antihydrogen to created antihydrogen was due to the maximum allowed temperature of antihydrogen at -272.55 degrees Celsius. This extremely low upper limit of temperature is because any antihydrogen above would have too much energy and would fail to be trapped inside the trapping section of the ALPHA machine. The low amount of captured antihydrogen posed obvious problems, receiving data from the antihydrogen was already difficult, so a larger sample size was needed in order to efficiently measure the antihydrogen emission spectrum and CPT invariance. This was where the ALPHA-2 came in, it  a laser system which further cooled the antihydrogen, and utilized a stacking procedure to obtain more antihydrogen (Ahmadi et al., 2017). The ALPHA-2 laser system caused the capturing of 20 antihydrogen atoms, and the stacking procedure allowed a grand total of 74 measurable antihydrogen atoms per trial (Ahmadi et al., 2017). This increased amount of antihydrogen atoms allowed feasible measuring of antihydrogen, and, by extension, testing of CPT for the first time.In April 2018, the ALPHA scientists completed initial testing of the antihydrogen emission spectrum. These scientists discovered the 1S-2S level of the antihydrogen and hydrogen emission spectrums were identical to a precision of 2 × 10-20 (Ahmadi et al., 2018a). This suggests CPT invariance is correct up to a precision of 2 × 10-20, and the physics fields which use CPT invariance to that level cannot be currently proved false of the grounds of CPT invariance failure. However, this was the first study to test antihydrogen’s emission spectrum against hydrogen’s emission spectrum, and so more testing  required, both on other energy levels of hydrogen and more precise measurements of antihydrogen’s 1S-2S energy level.During August 2018, the ALPHA scientists completed the first round of testing on the 1S-2P energy level of antihydrogen. T. Momose (personal communication, February 5, 2019) told me the challenge with the 2P energy level was that it was the first energy level to have angular momentum. However, the ALPHA team created another laser system to bypass this obstacle and allow them to measure the 1S-2P energy transition (Ahmadi et al., 2018b). The results were similar to the 1S-2S experiment results, in that the 1S-2P emission spectrums of antihydrogen and hydrogen were identical to a precision of 5 × 10-8 (Ahmadi et al., 2018b). This result also failed to disprove CPT invariance and suggests CPT invariance is indeed correct. Through the creation of the ALPHA-2 and the ALPHA team’s ingenuity, antihydrogen’s 1S-2S and 1S-2P emission spectrum has been measured and compared to hydrogen’s emission spectrum. Despite the identical emission spectrums so far, antihydrogen’s emission spectrum could still disprove CPT invariance. If a difference at any emission spectrum level were to be found, the difference would have the ability to override all identical emission spectrums, and still disprove CPT invariance. Despite the obstacles of measuring higher antihydrogen energy levels, such as fine structure interaction (T. Momose, personal communication, February 5, 2019), the ALPHA scientists’ ability to bypass the first obstacles in measuring a higher energy level suggests they will also be able to bypass future obstacles. This will allow the ALPHA scientists to measure other emission spectrum energy levels to test for CPT invariance as well. These future experiments will measure higher energy levels, and measure antihydrogen’s emission spectrum to a more precise degree, giving us an answer on whether on not CPT invariance is true. Can we truly trust our modern physics, which will govern everything from space travel to architecture? Only time and the antihydrogen emission spectrum will tell.
