Who am I? What does that question even mean? Is it my culture, my name, my achievements, or something else? Others define themselves by their grades, their athleticism, their morals, and more. I view myself as a hodgepodge of everything, confused about where I fit in. I don’t want to be defined by what others think. I want to be my own person, with no restrictions.My own persona. Nobody else’s. Just mine.Being a half-Hispanic, half-Caucasian person in a country as diverse as the U.S. has always stymied me about what culture to identify with. I go to Hispanic gatherings and do not fit in; I am lighter than anyone there. Hispanics speak to me in English and then seamlessly switch if I start speaking Spanish. The raucous, outspoken, Hispanic side of me with the language that rolls of your tongue, and the calm, intellectual, and soft-spoken white part contrasting like black and white. Visiting the Plaza Latina, a compact corner shop stuck behind a thriving Whole Foods is a whole different experience than visiting a normal grocery store. My mother slides right back into where she came from, haggling with the butchers behind the counter, picking the tortillas from the the narrow, tall, aisles stuffed full with Hispanic food, ranging from the everpresent Goya brand to basic red beans. This makes an impression on me, knowing how I came from this. All of this makes me feel like I can slide into cultures, but not fit perfectly, like a square peg in a round hole.	Do achievements set me apart? Do they make me me? The culture of Thomas Jefferson, one of the top-ranked high schools in the nation, promotes a cutthroat environment where an A is success, and extracurriculars are stacked like a pile of teetering books, waiting for any moment to crash down. This school can make anyone feel stigmatized for pursuing interests such as art and drama. At any given time, somebody in the school feels inferior when measuring themselves up against the person with all A’s, countless clubs, and a charity organization. I choose to measure my achievements for what they do for me. Not college. Not an internship. Not that priceless report card. My job, my sports, and my interests are my own.Italian baby name, coming from Mars, the Roman god of war. Meaning Mark in English, and meaning framework in Portuguese. Translated in countless other languages as , , Marcu, , , and Markus. None of that matters. A name is a label, and doesn’t mean anything until you change that. It is a blank chalkboard, waiting to be written on. It is empty space, waiting to be filled. Do I think about what my name means? No, not at all. I don’t want to be burdened by expectations, about famous people bearing my name that have gone on to do world-altering deeds. The famous explorer Marco Polo, who journeyed along the Silk Road and brought back information that would change civilizations forever. Professional athletes, using their skill and grace to inspire millions around the world. Musicians, conveying their feelings through their beautiful music.I want my name to be respected, the sound of it to be held in high esteem. But that doesn’t come from my name. It comes from what I do, how I help others, and how I do my work. Working on weekends as a youth soccer referee has taught me perseverance and the value of a job well done. Staying there on a rain-soaked field, the rain beating down on you, the bitter cold rendering your fingers unusable, admonishing players, and resting for five minutes between games has trained my mind and body to keep going. Some sets of games as long as 8 hours with no time to recover take a toll, but I need to do a good job. This sets me apart. My name is held in high esteem when I give others dignity and respect to make them feel valued, that is what makes my name revered. My name could mean anything, have any number of famous namesakes, but I make it my own.Just my own.A mother that has endured struggles such as immigrating as an 18-year-old to the US, enrolling in college, not speaking any English, working 2 full-time jobs, and being a mother to her middle-school age sister. A father growing up in the suburbs of DC, and surviving bone cancer as teenager majoring in a demanding music career in Chicago. The result was me, a hard-working, intelligent, and confident person who sets his own bar to clear.  I don’t base myself on other people, wanting to be accepted in their eyes.I am my own person, and I make a name for myself. Regardless of race, I am a biracial person seamlessly sliding in and out of both cultures. I am more than the sum of my parts.
