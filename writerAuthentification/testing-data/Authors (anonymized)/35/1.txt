After peering through the sheet of plastic and seeing the light emitting because the Balmer series, I wondered what other applications this lab, the hydrogen spectrum lab, could have. There was obviously was something more important than just the characteristics of the light. I started doing some research, and I found out about the dangers of hydrogen fires. The detection of hydrogen fires is crucial to many groups, including laboratories and the aerospace community. The research behind hydrogen fire detectors is based on ultraviolet, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and/or far-infrared flame emission bands.Because there is no spectrum yet made to compare hydrogen fire detectors, their merits are hard to compare. These problems have been brought up by organizations such as NASA, but the results made have not solved the problem completely. Technology such as a thermal imaging camera can also detect the radiant heat that hydrogen fires give off. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and can ignite with normal at a low air content because of the simplicity of the reaction. Organizations such as NASA have certain rockets like the Apollo Program Saturn V Rocket second stage that hold 70,000 kg of liquid hydrogen, and the Space Shuttle External Tank that holds over 100,000 kg of liquid hydrogen(Youngquist, Arens, & Starr, 2014). With these massive amounts of hydrogen lying around, precautions have to be taken to ensure the safety of many lives, which includes installing hydrogen sensors. These crucial steps can also be implemented in laboratories where they are working with pure hydrogen. In a paper written by researchers at Humboldt University in Berlin, they discuss how in their scenario, a hydrogen sensor showed encouraging results for the detection of fires in earlier phase compared to traditional detectors because they could identify advantages of the sensor for the  of smouldering fires when the external irradiance is lower as 15 kW/m2 and the temperature of the source under 500 °C (Kruger, Despinasse, Raspe, Northemann, & Moritz, 2017).  This shows how this kind of sensor can also be applied for detection of cases of pyrolysis, which is defined as decomposition brought about by high temperatures. However, other kinds of sensors are more optimal for quicker fire detection (Kruger et al., 2017). THis research goes to show that hydrogen sensors are multi-faceted, and useful for many different situations such as when pyrolysis is occurring or hydrogen is combusting.An article published in the Journal of Chromatography A developed a strategy to gather the synergy from devices that collect photons into a signal for ultraviolet spectroscopy, flame ionization, and mass spectrometry for compound analysis (Shellie, Luong, Haddad, & Gras, 2018). This shows that using the hydrogen spectrum can lead to advancements in other hydrogen fire related situations. Another article created an intensity calibrated hydrogen flame spectrum and burned pure hydrogen to produce a flame, and the spectral data from it covered the ultraviolet (200 nm) through far-infrared (13,500 nm) (Youngquist et al., 2018). Later on in their research, they mentioned how Kennedy Space Center had planned to update their infrared cameras, but it was not known at the time how the mid-infrared irradiance of a hydrogen fire was so much greater than the far-infrared emission (Youngquist et al., 2018). This might have changed their decision and made it a safer place. The cameras the Kennedy Space Center was using was a thermal imaging camera, which is used by firefighters for example to detect radiant heat being given off such as heat coming off of a hydrogen fire (Szajewska, 2017). However, the intensity calibrated hydrogen flame spectrum project was not funded for more research in that particular instance, which is a problem that needs to be fixed going forwards. Another source talks about the hazards and radiation from cryogenic jet fires. They mention in this paper that the CFD model to simulate thermal hazards from cryogenic H2 jet fires is optimal (Cirrone, Makarov, & Molkov, 2018). They also state that these simulations also reproduced the radiative heat flux from hydrogen jet fire from other places (Cirrone et al., 2018). This article shows that there are several different ways to model the thermal hazards from fires, and although the situation of this experiment dealt with jet fires, it can be applied to many other topics. When Dr. Youngquist, the corresponding author of the hydrogen flame spectrum paper wrote back to me, he mentioned in response to my question of if he came across any other ways of improving and comparing hydrogen sensors, that “...UV based sensors, while looking at very weak signals, have very high signal to noise performance and very few interfering background sources. So these detectors seem to have the best range/sensitivity/ and lack of false alarms.” (Youngquist, 2019).As stated earlier, this field is of utmost importance to science related fields, because of the danger that hydrogen leaks and flame have. This new research can be read and implemented around the whole world, preventing many fires that could save lives and prevent damage to property. Questions that have yet to be answered is to come up with a way of comparing devices that has improved upon more research and testing. Next steps would be to fund more research for places such as NASA, where they have a wealth of money and labs to improve upon their research.The hydrogen spectrum was not just a lab we did in a class, because it has implications all around the world and it can change certain landscapes of science. Laboratories and places such as NASA will be better off after this research has been completed and implemented throughout the world. Even though these fires cannot be seen, the results of this research are tangible in their rescuing.
