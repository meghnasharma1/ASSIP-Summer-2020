The seemingly clear liquids burst into an intense shade of canary yellow when they met. Potassium Iodide and Lead (II) Nitrate are two inconspicuous white powders in their normal state. However, when dissolved in water and combined, their molecules rearrange in a flurry of reaction to create Potassium Nitrate and Lead (II) Iodide, which gives us that vivid flash of color in the test tube. Reactions like these happen every day in nature, or they can be imposed in a lab like I did in class. The simplest reactions can give rise to amazing technology which could change society for good. The synthesis reaction hydrogen plus oxygen to water is no exception. Hydrogen fuel cells are an auspicious new technology that take advantage of this modest reaction to yield clean, renewable energy.The fuel of hydrogen fuel cells is hydrogen. A hydrogen fuel cell consists of an anode, or positive electrode, and a cathode, or negative electrode. With the help from a catalyst, hydrogen atoms are stripped of their electrons at the anode. Said electrons are put through a circuit to do work and then end up at the cathode. The electrons at the cathode are transferred to hydrogen and oxygen to create the one byproduct of hydrogen power - water. Hydrogen fuel cells have been around since 1838, when the English scientist Sir William Robert Grove first developed it. English scientist Thomas Francis Bacon developed the modern blueprint for a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell in 1933, which NASA has expanded upon for multiple applications, including the Gemini program in 1959 (Andújar & Segura, 2009).Since then, hydrogen power has burst unto the forefront of renewable energy technology. Hydrogen fuel cells are being implemented in novel technology including golf carts, forklifts, cars, and even the power systems of airplanes and buildings (“Let’s Look Towards Hydrogen”, 2019). Although hydrogen fuel cells have promising applications, the fledgling technology still has many shortcomings that must be overcome in order to be suitable for wide-scale use.In its organic state, hydrogen is a volatile and explosive gas. Research is being done on new methods to store hydrogen, as standard methods are often expensive or impractical. In a study by Cansizoglu, Badradeen, Wang, & Karabacak (2019), the hydrogen storage capabilities of Magnesium were increased significantly. Magnesium is a widely studied vehicle for hydrogen storage. However, disadvantages with its use exist, namely high activation temperature. The scientists in this study increased the storage capacity of Magnesium by altering its structure into nanoblades and nanotrees, nanostructures with high surface area to mass ratios. The researchers tested hydrogen storage of the nanostructures compared to a control, a simple film of Magnesium. They also used a variable temperature method to activate the magnesium. In this method, they slowly increased the temperature from 30 to 300 degrees Celsius over 150 minutes. The results of the study revealed that using nanostructures, the storage capacity of Magnesium increased. The highest storage capacity was achieved through the use of nanotrees in combination with the variable temperature method. Developing hydrogen storage methods is an important step in making any application of hydrogen fuel cell technology available for widespread use.The expense of hydrogen fuel cells is of tantamount importance to how we store their fuel. Without low costs, hydrogen power will never be used as universally as cheaper fossil fuels. A particular kind of fuel cell, an alkaline fuel cell (AFC), uses an electrolyte which allow hydrogen ions and oxygen atoms to react. AFCs must also have catalysts. Catalysts spur the rate of exchange of electrons in fuel cells, increasing efficiency. In typical fuel cells, platinum based catalysts are used, which are costly. A study conducted by Shi et al. (2019) made use of manganese oxide, an alternative, economical catalyst alternative to platinum. The ratios of three components, the catalyst, the ionomer (an extension of the electrolyte) and the carbon support (used to increase conductivity), were optimized in AFCs using manganese oxide. The researchers found ionomer concentration influenced the peak power performance of the AFC the most. (Shi et al., 2019) This data could help increase the efficiency of cheaper hydrogen fuel cells. Another study on catalysts made use of iron hydroxide and platinum nanoparticles to remove contaminants when obtain hydrogen. This catalyst works in a temperature range of -75 to 107 degrees Celsius (“The “Batman” in Hydrogen”, 2019). Being able obtain hydrogen at a wide range of temperatures is crucial to the development of hydrogen powered cars, which need to be able to operate in a range of conditions.Hydrogen powered cars are at the forefront of hydrogen fuel cell technology. They are an alternative to gas powered vehicles, which directly produce pollutants, and electric vehicles, which produce pollutants indirectly through the energy they consume. Car manufacturing companies such as Honda and Ford have even come out with car models which make use of fuel cells (Andújar & Segura, 2009). A study by Kaya & Hames (2019) aims to improve fuel efficiency and lifespan of hydrogen powered cars by changing the control mechanisms of their electronics. They make use of hydrogen fuel cells, lithium ion batteries, and supercapacitors in their models. Batteries and supercapacitors are used in conjunction with fuel cells because fuel cells cannot handle high energy spikes that occur in cars. The fuel saving control method used the supercapacitors and batteries more, and saved 100.6% percent more fuel compared to a standard control method. The lifespan increasing control method made use of the fuel cell more and was 1.8% more advantageous for lifespan as compared to the standard control method. This research gives yet another example of a field of hydrogen fuel cell technology that can be improved. The depth of the topic is vast, as can be seen through the diversity of the research presented in this essay. Hydrogen fuel cells are still a long ways from being usable in modern society, but we get a little bit closer to that point each day. The author of the fuel cell manganese catalyst article, X. Shi, gave their input on when they think hydrogen power will be fully integrated into society. “Optimistically, I would say in 20 years. The fuel cell has advantages in heavy duty applications, eg., ships, trains, airplanes, helicopters and trucks.”  (personal communication, February 5, 2019) These kinds of applications have just as much promise as hydrogen power cars, which demonstrates the versatility of this energy resource. Like I mentioned before, finding clean, renewable energy resources is imperative for the health of our planet and consequently, humanity. Developing hydrogen fuel cells brings us a step closer to a greener future.
