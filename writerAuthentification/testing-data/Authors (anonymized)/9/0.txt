I think that I changed tones in the middle of my story and it might seem a little odd. I also think my conclusion could be a bit better.*“If you have the people’s rejection, don’t fear -- you have God’s protection.”A beautiful day in Lukove, Albania. An effulgent sun peeks through the brilliant green leaves of an orange tree, warming the skin on contact. My grandfather at five years old is in the loving arms of his father. His father asks him which orange he’d like, and plucks the plumpest fruit from the tree to put into the hands of his son. He gives my grandfather his blessing and puts him down. On the way back to the house, my great grandfather collapses. He dies of a stroke two hours later.This is a story that my 87 year old grandfather, an Albanian, Greek, Orthodox Christian, has written about and conveyed to me countless times. Every time, he expresses his belief that without his father’s blessing and the help of god, he wouldn’t have made it to where he is today: living the American Dream. For a while, I didn’t understand.I remember walking down the aisle of Saint Agnes Catholic church, the stained glass bursting with color, a cool draft around my ankles. The shimmering lavish on the mahogany pughs, a chirpy organ. My palms open towards god. I remember my sunday school teachers telling me how gratifying it would be to be entered by the holy spirit, to consume the body of Christ on my first communion. “The body of Christ” is exactly what the priest said, and he blessed me with his blood-warmed fingers on my forehead in the shape of a cross. I picked up the small holy circle in my right hand, just as my mom had told me. It tasted like cardboard.I remember the indignation I felt, sitting in class on a cloudy sunday morning. I didn’t want to be at Sunday school, but my mom dragged me there anyways. On her side, we were catholic, and I would be too. In class that day, we were learning about homosexuals. The gays. They’re just confused. We still love them, but they need God’s guidance.  Rejection of science. Abortion. Molestation. Bullshit. I was angry at the Catholic church.I remember walking down the aisle, that same aisle of the Church that I’ve visited endless times before. I remember the stained glass, but it didn’t seem as bright. A bitter draft around my ankles, the uncomfortable pughs, an organ that sounded like a car’s horn. I was having my confirmation for reasons that I’ve forgotten. I wouldn’t forget the heavy hand on my shoulder.My uncle, a man that I looked up to. A musician like me. A good man, a christian man who read the bible. He was my sponsor for my confirmation. How is it that he’s been saved and I haven’t? Everyone on my mother’s side of the family firmly believes in God. Everyone on my dad’s side believes too - they’re Greek Orthodox. However, my ancestors were more faithful still.My pappou, my grandfather’s name is Orlando. It’s Italian, not greek. Why would a man Greek to his bones be anointed with an Italian name? The answer comes through history. I come from a line of Greek Orthodox priests, the ones whose chants sound like ghosts and whose beards are burning bushes. My great-grandfather was the first to break the trend and named his son Orlando in an act of defiance. My pappou still believes in heaven.But he’s been through hell. My pappou remembers when the tranquility of a beautiful spring day was shattered by the roar of engines. He remembers when the Germans bombarded their position with incendiary bombs hotter than the devil’s fury. He remembers when a line of 26 men were slaughtered for being too weak to work. He would have been one of them had not a German soldier knocked him out before he reached the line.After all he’s been through, why remain faithful? What has God done for him? The answer is simple. Everything.God comforted my pappou in his darkest hours. God gave him hope when all else was lost. God gave him the determination to get where he is today. But to me, I’m not sure whether there’s an entity out there that can snap their magic fingers to make everything better. But if you believe in something, truly believe, it’s real.Realer than anything anyone could ever tell you. My grandpa believes in God. So does the rest of his family. My uncle believes in God, in his own way. I don’t.I believe in people. Everyone has their beliefs. But no matter what those beliefs are, I think the person in front of them is thing worth believing in - family, friends, strangers, and yourself. *I want to include another anecdote here from my grandfather, something sunny again but later in his life*I hope my grandfather’s story will be remembered. He wrote about his life. He left a note to the reader: “Please: do some researching on this subject and you will see why I wrote this story. I refer to God’s protection. God was with me all the way.” My grandfathered believed in something, and I do too.
