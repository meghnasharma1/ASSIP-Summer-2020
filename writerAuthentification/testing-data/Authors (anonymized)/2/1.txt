The beanium lab was one of the first labs that we did at the beginning of chemistry this year. In this lab, we used beans to represent isotopes of an element and I remember thinking that there was no practical use for the work that we were doing. I thought that isotopes were just something that everyone had to learn about during chemistry class and that they were not used in the real world. That was until I was scrolling through youtube, and I found a video about new developments in chemistry, that used isotopes to trace sources of pollution. I immediately began to conduct further research into the topic, and I found that researchers at the University of El Paso had successfully traced the source of coal pollution using cadmium isotopes. 	Cadmium-114 is an isotope of cadmium that has a mass of 114 amu, 48 protons, and 66 neutrons. It is a byproduct of coal combustion that is produced in the boiler of a coal power plant. Cadmium-114 clings to the ash produced by coal combustion as the ash rises up the large chimneys of the power plant and is then released to the environment (Fouskas, Ma, Engle, Rupert, Geboy & Costa, 2018). Cadmium-114 is a heavy metal that extremely harmful to the environment and to humans. If ingested in large quantities, cadmium-114 could cause pneumonitis or even death (Fouskas et al., 2018). Instances of cadmium-114 contamination in Japan have even caused genetic abnormalities and Itai-Itai disease epidemics (Fouskas et al., 2018). 	The first article that I researched used cadmium isotope ratios from water samples obtained from areas surrounding coal power plants to successfully track cadmium contamination back to the coal power plants. To do this, they collected samples from varying distances surrounding the power plants and found the cadmium-114 isotopic composition of the samples. Cadmium-114 isotopic composition of a sample measures how much cadmium-114 is present in a sample. In their research, they found that as the distance from the coal power plants decreased, the cadmium-114 isotopic composition increased (Fouskas et al., 2018). Based on this trend, Dr. Fouskas was able to create a method in which the source of cadmium contamination could be found by mapping out the cadmium-114 isotopic compositions of multiple locations and locating where the compositions are at their highest. Dr. Fouskas tested his method parts of western Texas and was able to successfully locate 2 coal power plants by only using this method. 	The article written by Dr. Das was conducted in India, where cadmium pollution is much more common than in the United States (Das et al., 2018). This study aimed to accomplish a similar task to the previous research done by Dr. Fouskas. This study intended to identify the coal byproduct heavy metal contamination hotspots throughout India. Researchers did this by finding the lead isotopic compositions in water samples in a similar manner that Dr. Fouskas’ team did so. Dr. Das’ team found that the majority of heavy metal contamination in India was found in the northeastern region of the Chhattisgarh province (Das et al., 2018). The Chhattisgarh province of India is also well known for its coal mining industry as well as large unsophisticated coal power plants. Dr. Das commented on how these coal power plants do not have adequate waste management systems, which he believed to the primary reason behind high heavy metal contamination levels (Das et al., 2018).	In a study conducted in Hangzhou, China, researchers used cadmium isotopic compositions found in air samples to track their source. Dr. Li, the scientist who conducted this study, decided to test air samples instead of water samples because he thought that air contamination affected humans much more than water contamination. He also collected air samples from extremely populated areas. He did this because he wanted to discover how much cadmium pollution the people of Zanghou were truly exposed to. While Dr. Li anticipated that finding that the source of the cadmium contamination was a nearby coal power plant, he instead discovered that it came from paints used on the walls of buildings (Li, Jingxu, Zhou, Zhang & Jin, 2018). I contacted Dr. Li to ask him about his research. I asked him why he decided to track cadmium-114 isotopes in particular when he could have tracked any other element. I also asked him if his findings could be used to change public opinion on coal consumption. Dr. Li responded by saying (Dr. Li has not responded yet, I have also emailed his colleagues however I have not gotten a response).		This research has a multitude of real-world applications. The first of these is increased liability when it comes to heavy metal contamination. Now that the source of heavy metal contamination can accurately be found, power plants and corporations can now be held accountable for the pollution that they input into the environment. Therefore, water quality, as well as air quality, could be drastically improved, as sources of pollution could be identified. This research could also be used to locate areas with extreme heavy metal pollution, and adequate cleanup procedures could be implemented, or these areas could be avoided in general. This research could also be used to sway public opinion when it comes to coal combustion. By using cadmium-114 isotopic compositions, the true extent to which toxic pollution has spread could be publicized, therefore possibly swaying public opinion. Further research could be done on this topic by investigating if these same tracking techniques work with other possibly more toxic elements, such as chromium or vanadium. 	After conducting all of this research, looking at all the practical real-world applications of isotopes, I look back at the beanium lab completely differently. The beanium lab gave us an insight into what isotopes are and how they work. Isotopes can be used to reduce pollution, and improve the health of our environment in the future.
