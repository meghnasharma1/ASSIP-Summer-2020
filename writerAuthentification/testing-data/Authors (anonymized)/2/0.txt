The writer. That is the meaning of my last name in Arabic. Yet, I do not know of any of my family members of relatives that I have known that live up to that name. My Great Great Great Grandfather got that name. He was a famous calligrapher in Iraq, and he is most well known for his work on the shrine of Imam al Khadim, an important religious figure in Islam. He painted the intricate and complicated Arabic words on the doorway leading up to the shrine. I always imagined him gracefully brushing the labyrinth of ink and paints while perched on top of an old unstable ladder. I have seen the work of my Great Great Great Grandfather, while I was visiting my uncles and aunts in Iraq, and I observed how they took pride in our family for his achievements. However, none of them have ever lifted the a brush with the aim of carrying on my Great Great Great Grandfather’s legacy, and neither have I. But my name is Alkateb. The writer. How could I not take pride in such a thing. Despite his last name my grandfather always chose a textbook over a brush or pen. He studied hard until the age of 9, however, he was then forced to leave school and begin to work to help provide for his family, for this was not an uncommon practice in 1930’s Iraq. From then on my grandfather began to clean the streets to earn money, working long hours with little pay with  the harsh Arabian sun pummeling his delicate young skin. And after hours of manual labor, he used what little spare money he had to purchase books and to advance his education. By the time my grandfather was fifty years old, he had a net worth of approximately $14 million, which is equivalent to about $40 million adjusted for inflation. He owned the largest paint company in the middle east. While my Great Great Great Grandfather used paints to create great works of art, my grandfather created a multimillion dollar business creating the paints. Many people claim that they had a rags to riches story, but none of these compare to the story of my grandfather. However, my grandfather’s success was soon stripped away from him. In 1981, two years after Saddam Hussein took power, he seized all of grandfather’s money and assets and deported him and his family from the country. He was forced to flee to Iran, where he was granted residency, and luckily, he had kept a small portion of his money in offshore bank accounts, so they were left untouched. Although my Grandfather was a great success, his name was Alkateb. The writer.  My father’s name, the writer. However just like my grandfather he did not follow the footsteps of his predecessors. My father was forced to leave Iraq at the age of 13, a mere 2 years younger than I am. I try to imagine what he felt like, being deported from his home country having not committed any type of crime. My father then lived in Iran for a year and then moved to the united states with his brother when he was 14. My father did not know a single word of English and began high school in a country that he had never been to. What would he have felt walking into the cold hollow hallways of a foreign country? What would it be like to walk into a room and have a sea of stranger’s eyes look up at you at the same time whenever you walked into a room? My father said he never had many friends in high school, but that doesn't mean he did not succeed.	My father started his own telecommunications company about 12 years ago, and it is still growing to this day. He was a programmer, but his name was the writer. 	I do not consider myself to be a writer, as I write this very narrative the words struggle to reach my mind. Writing is not my favorite activity and I am adamant of this. I am cognizant of my family’s history, the legacy that my great great great great grandfather left behind. 	My Grandfather was a businessman, my father a CEO, and I am a student that cannot think about writing for more than five seconds. But our names meant the writer. Does this mean that our names do not make us who we are? Our names have meaning, but do they have meaning to the people that possess those names? Or are they just labels. If your last name were an empty box would it truly change anything? No. Because they are just names. My name means the writer. But is it truly my name?
