The class was silent, listening to the clicks of the Geiger Counter. We were observing the detection of beta particles emitted from Cesium-137 in a 30 second time period. As the cesium moved closer to the Geiger Counter, the number of beta particles detected increased significantly. On the other hand, when shielding like led was added between the cesium and the counter, the number of particles detected decreased significantly. After collecting our data, we learned the reasons behind this and its real-life applications including shielding of radiation from nuclear reactors. Shielding for nuclear reactors utilizes the same concept as the led that shielded emission of beta particles from cesium.	Nuclear reactors are one of the most important and effective sources of power. They work through nuclear reactions more specifically, nuclear fission and fusion. As a result, these reactions release energy. The problem with nuclear energy, however, is the radiation risk it poses to people and the environment. Radiation is energy traveling through space, emitted as electromagnetic waves or particles. One of the most known sources of radiation, the sun, gives off electromagnetic radiation. The difference between the radiation given off by the sun and the radiation given off by nuclear reactors is that nuclear reactors give off ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation carries enough energy to detach electrons from atoms or molecules, which can seriously damage tissue and organs. These factors justify the need for shielding technology.  Radiation shielding is based on the idea of using a barrier material to bounce or block rays in order to reduce their effect. This is also known as attenuation. There are several materials currently being used and researched for use in nuclear power plants however each of them have their own advantages and disadvantages.	The first material I researched was concrete, as it is a popular material used for radiation shielding due to its high density. The article I came across in my research discussed the effects of heating on properties of modified concrete mixes. The concrete mixes tested include goethite-limonite concrete (G.L), barite-limonite concrete (B.L), steel slag-limonite concrete (S.L), and dolomite concrete (D.C). The importance of testing the effects of heating on the properties of these mixes is due to the fact that nuclear reactors reach significant temperatures, and the abilities of their shields to function under these temperatures is needed in deciding on a material. Under 200 degrees Celsius, G.L was found to have the best fast neutron attenuation properties. However, after this temperature, it’s ability to attenuate fast neutrons decreased significantly. In terms of gamma-ray attenuation, B.L was found to have the highest values. The authors recommend both G.L and B.L concrete mixes for heat resistant radiation shields below 200 degrees Celsius (El-Samrah, Abdel-Rahman, & Shazly, 2018)	A material that caught my attention was chromium oxide doped borosilicate glass. I was interested in the idea of having a transparent radiation shielding material. The authors suggested glass over more commonly used materials as radiation shields such as concrete, due to its possible use in many applications(Aktas, Yalcin, Dogru, Uzunoglu, & Yilmaz, 2019). I noticed that as the chromium oxide content increased, so did the glasses ability to attenuate radiation, however, the researchers added chromium oxide in a range of 0.25% to 5%. as to why they stopped at 5% because its ability to attenuate radiation was not maximized. I emailed the main researcher, Bulten Aktas, and quickly received a reply. Aktas (personal communication, February 5, 2019) told me when he added more than 5% cr2o3 to the borosilicate glass its ability to attenuate radiation increased but the transparency of the glass disappeared. He considered 5% as the optimal value because he believed the material should be transparent.	The next material I came across in my research was boron carbide. Its ability to be incorporated into polyimides and attenuate neutron radiation makes it effective in nuclear power plants. The authors suggested the use of boron carbide over traditional heavy metals due to it’s light-weight, low cost, and simplicity to process(Li et al., 2019).  The researchers tested the thermal, mechanical and radiation shielding properties of polyimides with different weight percentages of boron carbide. In terms of thermal properties, the researchers noticed that as the weight percentages of boron carbide increased to 50% so did the thermal stability due to improved dispersion. On the other hand, the mechanical properties including tensile strength decreased. Lastly tested was the neutron radiation shielding. As the boron carbide content increased to 50% so did its ability to shield radiation. The researchers were able to conclude that 30% boron carbide would be optimal for nuclear radiation shielding as its thermal and neutron shielding properties are good enough without having to sacrifice tensile strength.	The growth of the radiation shielding market can be attributed to its global importance(Small Business Collection, 2019). The significance of shielding nuclear radiation comes from its harmful effects on the body. Accidents with nuclear radiation have proven to be disastrous, examples including the Cherynobl and Fukushima incidents. If the safety of all nuclear reactors is optimized throughout the world, accidents like these can be easily avoided. The optimization of nuclear reactors can also provide researchers with ideas on how to combat other types of radiation in the future, such as space radiation. The effects that space radiation has on the body is just as harmful as nuclear radiation, emphasizing the importance of coming up with a solution (Blanchett, 2017). Research and testing of different materials that have been used in nuclear radiation shielding may be the key to solving this problem.
