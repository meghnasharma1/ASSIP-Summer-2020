I don’t have blue eyes. I don't have brown hair. I don’t have white skin. However, I also don’t steal. I don't lie. I don’t fight. Part of my life I’ve been told these stereotypes about my race stigmatize my image so I would always have to be better or work harder than the average person gain respect. “It’s not fair” I would say to my mom. It’s not fair.I was reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. As a 9-year-old fascinated by Harry Potter, I slowly walked down the amber colored steps, my eyes focused on the captivating story in front of me, completely unaware of the world around me. It wasn’t until I peeked my head out from under my book and saw the look of despair on my mom’s face. It was the kind of look a parent gets when their child is in danger. The same look my mom got when I almost drowned. Fear, sadness, worry. “I need to talk to you,” she said. It was that day, when the African American teenager, Trayvon Martin was shot and killed when my mom first told me about the struggles I could face for the rest of my life because of my race.	Being only in 3rd grade, I was completely oblivious to discrimination against African Americans. We had not learned about slavery yet and with the intention of retaining my perfect, innocent view of the world, my parents didn’t tell me. It was a lot to take in, being told by my mom that not everyone would treat me fairly because of events that happened years ago that I had no control of.	I began to wonder how my life would be if I were white. If I had blue eyes. If I had brown hair. Would it be better? Easier? Would I have different friends? Over time I realized that I almost never noticed any racial prejudice towards me from others. Did my parents lie to me? Maybe I’m not black? As I got older I became cognizant of the fact that I didn’t encounter much prejudice because most people would treat me how I treated them and ignore my race. This erased my doubt and revived my hope that my race didn’t affect my treatment from others as long as I was a good person.	“Why don’t you play basketball?” “You should do track, you'd be good at it.” Sayings like these come from the stereotype that black people can jump high and run fast. These stereotypes aren't negative things, however, how they are used can make them negative. I don't mind people saying stereotypes because a lot of the time they are true, however, when someone uses a stereotype to judge another person it becomes a problem. Yes, some of the best basketball players are black. Yes, some of the fastest runners are black. This still doesn’t mean it applies to me. I know several black people who are horrible at both of these sports and several black people who are excellent at them.	When I was 13, one day I went to hang with some friends after a movie. It was a peaceful day. The sun was out, radiant and dazzling. The cotton ball clouds were calm, the sky; endless, clear, and mesmerizing. I sat down under a small coffee-colored tree with fresh green leaves. I picked at the leaves from the tree watching them fall into my lap. I didn’t even realize what I was doing until the police officer began to walk over. Suddenly fear overcame me. I wasn’t scared because I thought I had done something wrong. I wasn’t scared because of any past experience I had with the police. I was scared because the media and people around me put me under the impression that police kill black teenagers. The police officer calmly explained to me that what I was doing was hurting the tree. I apologized and the officer proceeded to have a full conversation with me. However, he didn’t scold me. He didn’t get angry at me. He didn’t pull out his gun on me. He asked me if I enjoyed my movie and how my day was going. How my day was going. A simple, sincere question.	After thinking about this situation, I realized what I did was judge the police officer based on a stereotype placed into my head by the media. This police officer could have been the kindest person on Earth, but because of the things I heard on the news and from my parents about just a few police officers, I automatically assumed he would be a bad person. It wasn't fair.
