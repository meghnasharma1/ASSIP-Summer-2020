Radiation has historically been an extremely applicable part of chemistry. Initially, it was used to see past what the naked eye could not and diagnose problems in bones and other internal tissues. Later on, scientists discovered it could be used to trace steps in biochemical pathways and pinpoint at which step problems were occuring. All of the almost boundless applications of radiation depend on one fundamental phenomenon: atoms releasing both energy and other subatomic particles to achieve a more stable configuration. Atoms are made up of protons, which have a positive charge, and neutrons, which have no charge. Thus, the heavier atoms that have many protons usually have excessive repulsion in their nucleus since like charges repel and usually give off some of these protons, a process we call radiation. In the previous two examples, this radiation bounces off other atoms and allows us to capture an image of what it bounced off of, producing X-rays or visualizations of biochemical pathways. However, this radiation can also penetrate cells and damage their DNA, eventually killing them. While this may seem like a negative consequence of radiation, it provides a huge advantage in eradicating malignant tumors consisting of cells gone rogue.   Normal cells constantly divide within our body, but sometimes, damage in their DNA can occur, causing them to divide much more than normal. This unchecked cell division in cells is known as cancer. Radiation therapy is a way of mitigating this problem, and it essentially functions by administering high doses of ionizing radiation to cancerous cells. This causes the cells’ DNA to be so damaged, it either dies due to irreversible loss of function or initiates apoptosis - programmed cell suicide (Abshire & Lang, 2018). However, there are many problems associated with performing radiation therapy of which the most major is unintentional damage to healthy cells causing the recurrence of cancer (Yao et al., 2018). In the past few years, researchers have created novel techniques to address such problems.Neutron radiation therapy (NRT) is a new form of radiation therapy that can solve arguably the most major drawback of conventional radiation therapy. Traditional radiation therapy fires X-rays at a malignant group of cancer cells and affects healthy cells in front of and beyond the tumor as X-rays penetrate the human body completely. This can cause the death of essential tissues necessary for overall function and even mutate previously healthy cells to become cancerous. Timoshchuk et al. (2019) developed a new methodology to solve this problem that instead utilizes neutrons to kill cancer cells. It essentially accelerates neutrons to very high speeds, almost the speed of light, and targets them to the tumor without penetrating beyond the tumor. Timoshchuk et al. (2019) further elaborates the energy at which the neutron is released can be fine tuned. Thus, the tumor can be treated with neutron radiation therapy in layers with each layer having different energy neutrons penetrating it. The study also states another benefit of NRT is it can be administered in higher doses to patients as there is a lower probability it will affect healthy cells. Dr. Laramore (personal communication, February 9, 2019) stated informing other physicians about the efficacy of NRT is a continuing process necessary to the future adoption of NRT to treat malignant tumors. Thus, by using neutrons as opposed to X-rays, NRT has created a more targeted approach to kill cancerous growths. Another novel approach to treating cancer through radiation is utilizing intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) as a form of neoadjuvant radiation therapy. Usually, before radiation therapy is used on a patient, a form of neoadjuvant therapy is given which shrinks the tumor and prepares the patient to receive the main treatment (Abshire & Lang, 2018). During traditional treatment methods, radiation is administered only to the region containing the tumor. However, cells on the border of the tumor may not be exposed to as much radiation which can later cause a ripple effect as they may lead to the recurrence of cancer and spread farther throughout the body, making them even harder to target (Hawkins et al., 2019). IORT is used directly after the main radiation therapy, and it utilizes a one-time high dosage of X-rays to eliminate cancer cells at the border of the tumor (Abshire & Lang, 2018). Hawkins et al. (2019) found by utilizing IORT as a form of neoadjuvant radiation therapy, the recurrence of cancer in patients was greatly decreased. IORT was able to preliminarily eliminate cancer cells at the border, effectively eliminating the problem of them spreading later on. The main radiation therapy was then able to eliminate the reduced tumor through use of high doses. Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) can be used to avoid parts of the brain when removing tumors due to its high specificity (Stoker et al., 2019). Stoker et al. (2019) found traditional X-ray therapy performs most of the damage at the beginning when first entering the body and later decreases its effect. However, IMPT performs almost no damage to the preceding tissues, but performs a great amount right before it stops, inside the tumor. IMPT uses a device called a synchrotron to accelerate protons to different energy levels and fires them at the tumor, causing them to lodge in the tumor. The study stated this therapy better preserved an essential part of the brain, the hippocampus, and has the potential to do so in other parts of the body. The study also found IMPT decreased the recurrence of cancer which holds great implications in pediatrics as it allows children receiving these therapies to continue to live healthier lives even after treatment. A revolution in radiation therapy has taken off over the last few years giving doctors a plethora of options to choose from to specifically meet their patients’ needs. Many techniques are allowing radiation therapy to become specific and beneficial in the long run, and if enough research is conducted on improving these therapies, the world may have a fix to a problem plaguing it for centuries.
