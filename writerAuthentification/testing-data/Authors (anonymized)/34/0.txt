“Number one, A, number two, B, number 3, D, number 4, A …” In America, people may visualize a teacher announcing the correct answers to a test or a student checking his answers to a homework assignment. A picture of someone yelling the answers to tomorrow’s test in a megaphone while disoriented students are frantically rushing to note them down as if their life depended on it (because in India, it does) is most likely not the first, or even last, impression that “Americans” get. Thirty years ago, such occurrences were the manifestation of the education system my dad was brought up in. And, although the mores of the time and place we live in today may consider this behavior unrefined, this tainting of character is exactly what formed my dad’s complex personality. Two years ago, I travelled to India with the most comfortable part of the trip being the plane ride: the cool and crisp air from the fan above, the warm blankets enveloping me only interrupted by the warm leather underneath. However, as soon as I made contact with the hot and humid natural climate characteristic of Indian July, I knew, I was stepping into my parents’ homeland. In the dark, I could merely sense the muggy environment but the next morning I felt it. The same sun that brought warmth in the snowy December winters beat down on me, burning away my energy. Every pile of trash raising the temperature 10 degrees. The smog issuing fountains of red from my nose. After a couple weeks, we traveled to my dad’s home city of Varanasi where things were impossibly worse. Stepping out of the house in the day was far from possible let alone unadvisable. One evening, on our way back home from a relative’s house, my mother pointed out my dad’s old “high school.” Hardly a school, it was a dilapidated cement box with a few holes where long-forgotten windows that may have once resided much before my dad’s time were replaced with remnant glass shards. How could my dad have gone from this place to Northern Virginia, one of the best places to live in America?  After we arrived back at home in Virginia, I asked my dad about his experiences at his high school. What he told me contradicted everything I had ever thought about success. My dad shared his experiences of skipping class to participate in the school cricket team, how kids in his school would steal others’ plants in botany class when theirs failed to grow, students jumping through the windows during breaks and escaping to the movies to escape the ennui of the classroom. When I further questioned my dad about his education in India, he told me even more intriguing details. For example, he explained that in order to support his close friend during his sickness, he took 6 months off from school and was forced to redo everything he had learned. My dad had developed as a person throughout his academic career and had never thought twice about the toll it took on his education and today, through these many life experiences, he has become a successful person who was able to surmount his poor conditions. Today, I have attained great academic success but at price I didn’t know I was paying. My constant dedication to school has never allowed me to take a step back in life and develop more on my identity. Starting from seventh grade, it was my ultimate aspiration to be able to go to the best STEM school in the United States. I sacrificed days, months, and over a year to simultaneously further my knowledge in STEM, maintain good grades, and prepare for the admissions exam for TJ. However, in achieving this goal, I obligated myself to relinquish parties with my friends, my non-academic hobbies, and my fitness. I obligated myself to relinquish who I am. Now, I am rediscovering myself and my personality outside of school. On weekends, I volunteer to help younger students who are in similar circumstances as I was in with a variety of subjects. In addition, I regularly exercise and maintain my fitness to be the healthiest version of myself.I want to be able to flood my life’s bucket with experiences and memories of who I am during my lifetime. And although only recently am I beginning to fill my bucket with miniscule drops of doing, throughout my lifetime, I will have aggregated an ocean. I don’t need to know everything, just one thing, myself.
