She looked back one last time as tears streamed down her face. A sea of familiar faces: friends, relatives, colleagues waved farewell behind the stanchions. Past these barriers and through the gates to a foreign world beyond the borders of the place she called home, my mother continued.A mere two months ago this woman was living a moderate life as a graduate student in a country commonly overlooked. But to her, Bulgaria was the only world she had seen, where she had lived her entire life. She had never ventured outside the comfort of her two-bedroom apartment. For a woman in Bulgaria, my mother had exceeded expectations of success, attaining a masters degree in mathematics from the most prestigious university in the nation. She continued to fulfill the societal role of a Bulgarian woman: keeping the household intact. My parents had built a life together: a home, a young daughter, a family. One Saturday morning, as the golden sun rose into the bright blue sky and my family breezed through another morning routine, my father encountered a peculiar envelope while perusing the daily mail. He opened it and read the message. The words jumped out at him. Holding the letter which provided the monumental opportunity of a lifetime, his eyes glued themselves to the page. Curious about the letter that captivated my father, my mother strode over to the coffee table where he was sitting. Her heart skipped a beat; the moment seemed surreal. What rested in my father’s hands was what every Eastern European fantasist dreamed of at the time: a ticket to America. America was the land of opportunity, the place my mother only visualized from the movies and TV shows in which everyone lived a fortunate, prosperous life in an idyllic setting. Thousands of times she had envisioned the bustling streets, the towering skyscrapers, and the wailing sirens. They had waited thirteen years they had waited for this miracle. Yet, she couldn’t help but notice the enlarging knot in her stomach. Never had she thought about receiving a green card, let alone making the life-changing decision to move across the ocean.Contemplating the future of their lives for weeks, my mother and father decided to sacrifice themselves and leave all of their accomplishments behind. They would build their entire lives from scratch to fulfill one hope: opportunity for their children.Relatives and friends gathered at the airport to wish my parents luck on their journey to the unknown. My mother weeped as she said her goodbyes. My father attempted to mask the fears building up inside of him. Turning their backs on their homeland and beginning the path toward their new life, they continued.With nothing but a mere two suitcases and a couple hundred dollars scraped together from their lifetime savings, they stepped into a foreign world: unfamiliar streets, unfamiliar faces, unfamiliar language. The idealized life portrayed in the movies was obscured by reality.Day after day my mother tried to assimilate into society, but at times it seemed like success was impossible. She could sense the judgement pierce through her every time she opened her mouth to speak. She noticed the glares from the corner of her eye as she passed by others in her démodé outfits. Yet, she refused to abandon her culture in the past. She continued.The career rejections were innumerable; the hope dwindled. America was depicted as the land of opportunities, but it seemed like my parents had taken steps backwards instead of progressed. On numerous occasions did they contemplate surrendering and turning back to the familiar land where they came from, yet they persevered through the discrimination and the hardships.Twenty five years later, my parents still continue to fight to provide opportunities for my sister and me. They face an ongoing struggle with the language, and the nostalgia in their faces is evident as they dive into photos from the past or reminisce about memories.Every year since I was born, we return back to Bulgaria to visit our relatives and our family origin. I always wondered why my parents were so insistent on maintaining family ties and teaching us about our culture. They regularly stressed the importance of never rejecting our heritage, and instilled traditions in us through our annual trips.As we departed back to the United States from one of our summer stays in Bulgaria, our regular group of family and friends gathered at the airport. We passed by the same stanchions and through the gates, leaving behind our relatives as we have year after year. As we continued further and further away, the familiar faces blended into a blur. I noticed the routine tears streaming down my mother’s cheeks, and I comforted her. “Come on Mom, let’s go home.” Discerning the look in her eyes at the retreating blurry faces, the idea suddenly overcame me: my mother doesn’t belong to one sole home. Even after 25 years of her alternative life, a piece of her still longs for the origins she traded for opportunity. Torn between two disparate worlds, the struggle to balance both only grows. Nevertheless, she continues.
