Time flowed like cement. I stared into empty space as the minute hand on the clock trudged on second by second, minute by minute. Sitting in Biology class, I struggled to prevent my thoughts from wavering. Peering at my classmates, I could see the drooping heads, the eyes hibernating in their sockets, all typical characteristics of a student’s early morning. From caffeine to bright light, it seemed as though everyone had their own way of coping with overwhelming drowsiness. As I stared directly at the bright lights on the ceiling, I could suddenly feel my body start to waken. In recent years, students have struggled to stay awake in the classroom and maintain their focus. Morning drowsiness has impaired not only adolescents’ ability to learn but has also affected the adult population through the danger of drowsy driving. A common mechanism to combat this fatigue is the chemical caffeine (C8H10N4O2), which is used to improve mental alertness. However, caffeine increases risk of depression and causes blood glucose levels to surge. Recently, scientists have discovered a possible alternative in the form of a natural phenomena: light (Choi, Shin, Kim, Chung, & Suk, 2019). When atoms of elements enter an excited state through the input of energy, their electrons jump energy levels. The consequential drop of these electrons from a high-energy state back to their low energy stage results in the emission of electromagnetic radiation including visible light. Electrons which drop back to the n=2 level emit of visible light which we observed during the Hydrogen Spectrum Lab. Particularly, a type of visible light of short wavelength called blue light is employed in several studies involving alertness. In order to conduct research outside of the laboratory setting, Motamedzadeh, Golmohammadi, Kazemi, & Heidarimoghadam conducted a study in 2017 which directly tested the effects of light on the cognitive performance of factory workers. The study included 30 staff members in the petrochemical industry. The subjects were first exposed to control lighting conditions of white light, and data was recorded. The researchers used the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, the Conners' Continuous Performance Test II, and a salivary melatonin assessment. Next, the individuals were exposed to two different blue-enriched lighting conditions (17,000 K and 6500 K) and underwent the same assessments. Data analysis revealed workers in the industry exposed to blue light exhibited a reduced expression of melatonin and therefore less sleepiness compared to the control. They also portrayed decreased reaction time and work errors along with improved memory and sustained attention (Motamedzadeh, Golmohammadi, Kazemi, & Heidarimoghadam, 2017). The study extends its findings by explaining the chemical and biological aspects behind these results. The photoreceptors such as melanopsin in the retinal ganglion cells are more sensitive to short-wavelength light (blue light) and trigger brain responses (University of Haifa, 2017). Therefore, blue light synchronizes the circadian rhythm. Overall, the research concluded blue light exposure tended to improve work performance.However, since the study was conducted in the field, the scientists had less control over the design and possible confounding variables. A more controlled study conducted by Studer et al. revealed the effects of different light on sleep and cognitive function. The researchers exposed a group of 28 adolescents to two treatments: red-enriched light in the mornings and blue light in the evenings or vice versa. After treatment, they assessed cognitive performance through computerized attention and math tests. Furthermore, they used actigraphy, a sensor which measures sleep awakenings, to quantify sleeping behaviors. Regarding attention and cognitive performance, the results revealed high intensity blue light led to beneficial effects. The individuals tended to not only exhibit improved performance on assessments but also had a faster reaction time in attention tests (Studer et al., 2019). Like in other studies, blue-enriched light resulted in a significantly higher number of sleep awakenings than the red-light exposure (University of Haifa, 2017). Consequently, the researchers found blue light in the mornings and red light in the evenings resulted in the most normal circadian rhythm (Studer et al., 2019).	Aside from the data obtained from sef-reporting, a related studied drew a relationship between hormone production and blue light. Choi, Shin, Kim, Chung, & Suk conducted a study which consisted of 15 young adults who were exposed to one of two lighting treatments, 3,500 K warm white light or 6,500 K blue-enriched light, for a period of 2 hours. Following treatment, the researchers measured levels of the hormones cortisol (C21H30O5) and melatonin using saliva samples in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Choi, Shin, Kim, Chung, & Suk, 2019). Melatonin (C13H16N2O2) is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland which induces sleepiness (Public Library of Science, 2016). The findings revealed melatonin production declined when subjects were exposed to blue light compared to warm light, but there was no statistically significant difference in cortisol levels. Nevertheless, an upward trend in cortisol was observed with blue-light exposure (Choi, Shin, Kim, Chung, & Suk, 2019).  The corresponding researcher Professor Hyeon-Jeong Suk (personal communication, February 7, 2019) stated, “With a small group of subjects, not statistically significant though, an observation of consistent trend is also quite meaningful.” Additionally, the researchers assessed the factors of sleepiness and mood using wearable sleep trackers, sleep logs, and ratings. Data analysis showed exposure to blue light improved both alertness and mood among the subjects (Choi, Shin, Kim, Chung, & Suk, 2019). Overall, the results of this study led to the conclusion blue-light may be an effective method to stimulate wakefulness through a decrease in melatonin production.Throughout our everyday lives, many daily tasks require the utmost attention. From adolescents in a learning environment to adults in the workplace, cognitive awareness is crucial. Yet, morning and night time drowsiness are prevalent and impair performance. Furthermore, drowsiness can result in severe accidents through both driving and in the workplace (Choi, Shin, Kim, Chung, & Suk, 2019). As numerous studies have shown, blue light can be utilized to combat this fatigue. By implementing it in schools, cars, and the workplace instead of warm lighting, the blue light we have produced in the Hydrogen Spectrum Lab has the ability to help progress mental capacity, avoiding accidents and even death (Studer et al., 2019). Recent studies have even found primitive evidence of how blue light exposure can decrease high blood pressure and increase the synthesis of protective blood molecules such as nitric oxide, mitigating cardiovascular diseases (University of Surrey, 2018). Further research on the relationship between light and its true effects on humans must be conducted, but implementation of blue light in the future has vast potential to stimulate productivity, reduce diseases, prevent deaths, and help students fight the morning drowsiness faced daily in the classroom.
