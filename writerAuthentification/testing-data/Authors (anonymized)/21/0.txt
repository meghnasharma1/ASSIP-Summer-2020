Everyone knows that artsy kid in their class. I really envied them during elementary school, the fame that comes with creating impressive works. I loved drawing, but during that time I felt like I was known more as an origami kid, which was a free market back then. Soon the time came for middle school and I decided to choose art foundations as an elective. It was only a semester long and a prerequisite for many other art classes. We all got sketchbooks and I filled mine with unskilled drawings that would make me mortified if anyone saw them. Even with my jejune artwork, I managed to get good grades in the class. One day, she announced to the class that about her art extensions class and gave several students a paper. I received one. She told us that we should return the paper with a signature if we wanted to take art extensions and it was a first come, first served basis. I took it home and read the paper. It was a yearlong class, so I would have to sacrifice my other elective spot if I decided to join. I turned it in the next class. Eighth grade comes, and I head to my art class. There were girls everywhere. Out of a class of thirty, there were only two guys. We got our seats and started the year. At first it seemed like art foundations, we went to the idyllic courtyard and did some contour drawings. The class drew quietly, but it didn’t last for long. My classmates started getting up and waving to their friends as people inside were walking by to the cafeteria, but I never saw any of mine. All my friends either took an art class or drew a lot. As the year progressed I made some new friends, many of which were in my art class. I never sat with them, even during the time the class got to choose their seats. I sat with a bunch of girls I didn’t know and thought that until the next seat change I was going to be awkwardly working alone while my tablemates talked. We were starting the clay unit, which was always fun, but I’ve never made anything worthwhile using clay before. However, my new tablemates were very friendly and loved the design of my clay piece, which at its core was just a cactus with a top hat and mustache and started calling it Sir Cacticus. After that I started talking to them more. We would always laugh as we discussed our ideas for projects and asked each other for suggestions and advice. I began to share with them more of my personal art, which I felt I had greatly improved during my time taking art extensions. Most of my drawings were smaller than the palm of your hand, but they were as varied as the calls of birds. Some factors that made the class one of my favorite classes of all time was not only my supportive classmates, but also my teacher. I had her for art foundations and thought she was decent, but I really liked her as my art extensions teacher. She gave the class a lot of freedom, which made the class fun and entertaining. We could also handle having the freedom, as even though we talked and walked around the room, we kept on track and got our work done. Some of the wilder things that happened during class was someone riding in a trashcan and the mannequin challenge. The mannequin challenge happened during the clay unit, which allowed for some more silly poses. People pretended to duel with rolling pins and spray each other with water bottles. Some people showed off their clay sculptures or pretended to be on their phone. Our fun times in art ended with a happy note, as we celebrated the last day of middle school with a cake and some ice cream. Earlier in the year I had asked my art teacher for a recommendation for TJ and I managed to get in. However, none of my close friends got in. During my freshman year I didn’t take art as I only had one elective slot open and I had to take computer science before junior year. Nowadays I don’t draw as much because I don’t have a lot of free time to do such things. I don’t really have many people to share my art and draw with. I don’t know how to draw anything other than birds. My drawings aren’t as creative as they used to be. Am I back to square one?
