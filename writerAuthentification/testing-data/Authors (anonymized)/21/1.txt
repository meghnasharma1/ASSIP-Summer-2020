The use of membranes in biomimetic drug delivery systemsDuring the intermolecular forces lab, I learned about the forces that hold molecules together. In the lab I learned about three intermolecular forces, dispersion, dipole-dipole, and hydrogen bonds. We studied the molecular structure of two alcohols and inferred how strong the forces were for both. Then we studied the evaporation rate of each alcohol, as that is one of the properties determined by the intermolecular forces a molecule has. Nanotechnology includes bottom-up approaches, which require keeping in mind the intermolecular forces between molecules when using them to build your nanotechnology.		Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, with one out of three people getting cancer in their lifetime. One in five people will die of cancer in their lifetime (American Cancer Society, 2018). There already exists some options for cancer patients, but they often damage healthy cells and come with unwanted side effects. So a new type of treatment is being researched, nanomedicines. Nanomedicines is a branch of nanotechnology, which is the manipulation of atoms and molecules from an atomic to a supramolecular scale. The concept of nanotechnology was introduced in 1959 with Richard Feynman’s famous speech, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom”.MOF       In June of 2018, researchers at the Pennsylvania State University published a primary research article on the development of a protein delivery system using metal-organic framework nanoparticles coated with an extracellular vesicle membrane derived from the targeted tumor itself. They found that the extracellular vesicle membrane managed to camouflage the proteins from the immune system and also helped the nanoparticles target cancer it was coated in. I can use this information to talk about the ways a membrane coating can be useful when developing a biomimetic nanoplatforms. Biomimetic nanoplatforms are being developed with the goal of having fewer side effects and high efficiency (Cheng et al., 2018 in-text citation).Biomimetic surface modification	In February of 2019, researchers at the Yonsei and Kansas State Universities in Gangwon-do, Korea and Manhattan Kansas respectively, published primary research on their new discoidal polymeric particles design with red blood cell membranes. They researched this because they wanted to develop a safe drug delivery system using material properties to achieve specific results such as avoiding destruction from immune cells and a long blood circulation half-life. This information can be used to fight cancer and track its progression. They found that a red blood cell coating can extend blood circulation half-life and also managed to camouflage the discoidal polymeric particles from being eaten by white blood cells. This information fits my topic as I am researching the benefits of cell membrane coatings for drug delivery and killing cancer.ErythrocyteIn May of 2019, researchers at the Clinical Laboratory and Department of Blood Transfusion of the Third Xiangya Hospital in Changsha, China. These researchers published a primary research article which looked at the therapeutic effect of a red blood cell membrane coated 2D nanomaterial on cancer tumors. It found that the blood cell membrane effectively stopped the molecules from being intercepted by the liver or kidney. This research was done as traditional chemotherapy has many unwanted side effects that may be solved by using nanoparticles, such as a high dosage and low efficiency. This article fits into my research as I am investigating the effect of using membranes to cloak and enhance the performance of nanotherapeutics.Even though experiments in the lab have produced favorable results, most are on animals(mice in this case) and may not be as effective in humans. There also is concern about the storage of nanomedicines and the production as some methods also require cells from the patient themself. Nanomedicine is a billion dollar industry and even though development has started quite recently, there are already over 50 nanopharmaceuticals currently available for clinical use.
