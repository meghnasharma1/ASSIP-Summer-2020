Habits are hard to break. Every Sunday my family goes to church. This week my family went to church on Sunday, just like we always do. All six of us file into our usual pew, a few back from the front, the right side of the left half, taking up half the row. We worship and sing, pray and confess. In the middle of every service, the pastor leads us in “the giving of the peace.” The congregation stands as old friends and new acquaintances greet each other with smiles and handshakes. After everyone’s settled down again, and the pastor starts talking, my mom pulls a small bottle of hand-sanitizer out of her purse, and attempts to discreetly pass it across the row. Each of us squirts a bit onto our hands, washing away the possible germs that may have been given to us along with the peace.	Habits are hard to break. It’s been almost seven years since my dad was diagnosed with leukemia, yet we still pass along the hand-sanitizer at every church service. My dad has often laughed at this habit, joking that we go from “Peace be with you,” to “Let’s wash all your germs off.” But the hand sanitizer bottle is still passed around each week, and, with it, a small reminder of our family’s past. 	When I was nine years old, my siblings only seven, four, and two, our parents planned a third trip to Disney World. We flew down to Orlando, Florida, and for a week we rode rides, met princesses, ate sugary foods, and watched sparkling fireworks, immersed in the magic of an amusement park. Everything wasn’t as magical as Disney should be though. Throughout the week, strange bruises started appearing on my dad’s body. He got motion sick on most rides we went on. He stoped eating meals at restaurants. Noticing something must be wrong, he saw a local doctor, who claimed it was only an upset stomach from dizzying rides and normal bruises from be jostled around. He was supposed to be fine. 	We got back to Virginia, back to normal, except my dad wasn’t back to normal yet. The large bruises kept appearing, and he still felt sick. My dad’s friend drove him to urgent care. We thought he’d be back that same night, maybe with some new medicine or instructions, and a promise of quick recovery. 	“The doctor’s want me to stay at the hospital. They still don’t know what’s wrong.” My dad said over the phone that night.	“How long until you can come home?”	“We don’t know yet.” I told him I loved him sotto voce, biting my lip to keep in tears. This phone call for me marks a change, a beginning of a new chapter, one filled with hospital visits, test results, hoping for a cure, and hair loss. Our regular routines were flipped upside down. My dad was always at the hospital, and my mom was balancing his health and looking after us four kids. Some mornings we’d wake up to my mom, and our familiar old mornings, others we woke up to a family friend ready to brush our teeth, pour our cereal, and get us in our uniforms and out the door on time. After school we often visited my dad. We learned all sorts of card games and how to play cribbage and what was the best to buy at the hospital food court. The months went by, birthdays spent around a folding card table squished in the corner of a hospital room in between chemo treatments and blood cell counts. 	It being seven years ago, I don’t remember everything from this season of winter and spring, but surprisingly the things I remember the best are moments that make me smile. I couldn’t tell you exactly what tests or treatments he had, but I can remember all sorts of good times spent in that hospital. I loved getting to visit him and cheer him up, even just for a moment. One day my dad wanted to get out of bed and do something. The hospital hallway had two markers on the wall, and if you walked back and forth a certain number of times, you could walk a mile. My dad and I were determined to walk an entire mile. We paced back and forth, wheeling his IV stand, for the longest mile I’ve ever walked. At the end we proudly returned to his room, exhausted with the large amount of exercise. The nurse laughed, and presented our reward for a race well walked, two cups of chocolate ice cream. 	Even though that winter and spring were hard, my family rallied together with incredible support from our extended family and friends. My church small group prayed with me on Sunday evenings, hugging me extra hard the weeks when things felt hopeless. Families from school and church signed up to bring us meals, keeping us well fed and loved on family recipes. People gave us rides, comfort, and company. 	Towards the end of spring, nothing was working. My dad was still in the hospital. He’d been there for months. The doctors told my parents about a newer treatment option, called a stem cell transplant. Essentially, or at least how my nine year old brain understood this to be, they were going to kill off his immune system, hopefully flushing out the bad cancerous cells. Then they’d take stem cells, cells that can turn into anything from an umbilical cord, and replace his cells with those, starting a new immune system. We didn’t know if it’d work, but it was one of the few remaining options. So, we tried it.	The one problem with this new treatment plan: the hospital by us didn’t do stem cell transplants. Thankfully the nearest hospital that did stem cell transplants was UVA in Charlottesville, which wasn’t too far away, but was still felt far. So, we moved to Charlottesville for the summer. My parents went down before school was over to start the transplant. I remember the day my dad left. We sat down at our dinner table for devil dogs, a special family treat, and my parents brought us a movie to watch altogether. Then they left. My aunt and uncle came, and watched over us the rest of the week. We baked a cake and watched the movie again, trying to make the hardness of that day a little bit easier. 	For the remaining month or so of school, different aunts and uncle, grandparents, and friends cycled through watching us. We went down to visit my dad on weekends, and went to school, 100 or so miles away from my dad. Until, finally, we moved down to join the rest of our family.	In deciding to go through with the transplant, my mom had no idea if we’d be able to pull it together. We didn’t have a place to live in Charlottesville, a place for the kids and my dad once he was discharged from the hospital. We didn’t know how being separated for the first month would work. We didn’t know if the transplant would save my dad. 	That summer went from one huge question mark to one of the most memorable. We found an apartment we could rent for the time we needed, fully furnished, with a gorgeous view of the mountains. Friends helping drive us to and fro before school went out, or to make swim team meets, and even brought us essentials, such as a crib. 	My dad had the transplant. It worked. I remember the day the blood counts were finally were they needed to be, cheering at the thought of recovery. My dad was able to go live at the apartment earlier than we expected. The Olympics were on that year, and we ate popcorn, watching the different events. We took walks around the apartment complex each night with my dad, finally outside instead of a sterile hospital hallway, going further each night. We found new pizza places, and went apple picking at Carter’s mountain. We swam in the nearby pool, and drove dad to the clinic.We played more cribbage. My mom taught me how to make grilled cheese sandwiches, and we ate lunches al fresco on the the little balcony of our apartment. My dad continued to get better. 	Finally, that fall, my dad was able to return home. It wasn’t permanent, he still had to go back to the hospital with pneumonia multiple times, kidney surgery, and appendicitis. But, he had survived the cancer, and fully recovered from all the medical problems that fall.	It’s now been seven years since all that. My dad is fully back to normal. We share many hobbies, mainly loving to have hobbies and learn a new skill, and I love being able to continue to draw, walk, bike, hike, swim, birdwatch, garden, cook, read, play guitar, and laugh with him. He no longer goes frequently to his oncologist, or has to get admitted to the hospital for every cold. He can eat at buffet lines, and can eat watermelon. He can’t eat shellfish, which was an unfortunate and weird allergy that developed with his transplant, but other than that he’s his normal self. Still bald, but his beard has grown back. 	Old habits are hard to break. They can stick with us. We still pass that bottle of hand sanitizer around, first developed when my dad didn’t have a strong immune system, and we’ll probably continue to pass it for who knows how long. It’s a small reminder of what my family’s gone through. Of the people who helped us, and the prayers that carried us, and the experience of learning that we can’t take life for granted. The year my dad got cancer was probably the hardest year I’ve ever had. But, it taught me lessons like germs are everywhere and living life to the fullest. Life is never going to be without struggles. But it’s through those struggles that I’ve found the most growth. My faith grew. My friendships grew. And my family grew closer.
