Pressing my face to the cool glass of our 100 gallon saltwater fish tank, I watched as a myriad of colorful fish swam amidst a few vivid corals. My dad pointed to one of the corals in the tank, explaining that corals were actually made up of thousands of tiny animals called polyps, and that the fish, snails, coral and algae inside our tank were all an important part of a coral reef ecosystem. Years later, I heard how coral reefs were dying off rapidly. I saw pictures of a vast blue landscape filled with stark white skeletons, devoid of life. Was this really a coral reef? It looked nothing like the fish tank that once sat in our house, filled with different animals and colors. The picture was a coral reef, and would’ve looked like the scene inside my fish tank at someF point, but was a victim of “coral bleaching.” My understanding at the time was that coral bleaching was what turned a sea of beauty into a graveyard. A few months ago, as a sophomore currently taking chemistry, I sat in class listening as my teacher explained why atoms of different elements bond together to form different compounds. Atoms have different numbers of electrons in their outer shell, called valence electrons. A valence shell can hold up to eight electrons, and in this case the atom is the most stable. This is called the octet rule. Other atoms bond together when they share or exchange electrons to create a full valence shell, fulfilling the octet rule. I recently came across a recent study done on coral bleaching, and I was shocked when I realized I understood the scientific concepts, thanks to my general knowledge of chemistry. I learned that corals “bleach” when they expel algal symbionts called zooxanthellae (Elias. 2018). The zooxanthellae inside coral polyps are responsible for a coral’s brilliant color, and the algae photosynthesizes, producing energy for the polyp, while the polyp in return provides shelter and access to sunlight (Elias. 2018). This article went on to explain the current oxidative theory of why corals bleach (Nielsen, Petrou, & Gates, 2018). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during photosynthesis by the algae (Nielsen et al., 2018). ROS are superoxide anions, O2-, the negative charge sign meaning it has an extra electron, or a free radical, which does not satisfy the octet rule (Nielsen et al., 2018). Because of the extra electron, ROS are extremely reactive, bonding extremely easily (Nielsen et al., 2018). In the algae symbionts, superoxide dismutase works against ROS with an electron reduction, or the oxygen gaining an electron, balancing the charge (Nielsen et al., 2018). It converts ROS to hydrogen peroxide, which is quickly desynthesized into water and oxygen gas (Nielsen et al., 2018). The reason corals expel their symbionts is because as waters warm, the photosynthesizing algae produce more ROS than the antioxidant defenses can handle, and the ROS can harm the host, leading to the algae’s expulsion (Nielsen et al., 2018). This process is why reefs worldwide are no longer colorful and full of beauty, but starkly white and devoid of life. Coral reefs are extremely important to our world, as they are home to over 25% of marine life (Elias. 2018). Covering less than a hundredth of the earth, corals are shrinking due to a large list of threats, such as overfishing, pollution, climate change, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and invasive species, with the driving force behind all of these threats being humans (Elias. 2018). Scientists are predicting that by 2050, 70% of coral reefs may be completely destroyed (Elias. 2018). A world without corals would be devastating, not just to the estimated 3,235 fish, snails, lobsters, and corals dependant upon reefs, but to humans as well (Elias. 2018). Reefs stabilize coastlines by reducing wave energy by up to 97 percent and wave height by up to 84 percent (Elias. 2018). Countries would have to spend large amounts of money on flooding damage in reefs disappear (Elias. 2018). Many countries would lose relied upon revenues from the tourist industry, with estimates predicting 500 million people’s jobs gone and over $30 billion annually (Elias. 2018). Every year we’re losing more and more corals, many after mass bleaching events due to record high temperatures (Elias. 2018). In response, scientists are quickly trying to find ways to stop coral reefs from dying out (Albright, 2018). In my paper, I’ll be looking at three recent studies  showing current strategies scientists are hoping may save our reefs. This ranges from management strategies, to repopulating reefs, and even to extreme proposals of creating “supercorals.” A recent study published early next month is looking at resilience-based management (RBM), and how it might help reefs recover from severe bleaching events (Mcleod et al., 2019). This is not a preventative strategy, rather it supports reef recovery. Defining RBM as using knowledge of what is causing coral reef degradation to create management actions to sustain the ecosystem, the study argues that RBM is a viable option for reef management (Mcleod et al., 2019). It explains how a resilience-based management program is different than a single-species or ecosystem-based management system, as it manages the ecosystem to benefit human welfare, maintain diversity, with large amounts of change or uncertainties in mind, and by understanding that humans are a part of the ecosystem and will be apart of changes (Mcleod et al., 2019). The priorities of RBM include protecting biodiversity, reducing reef stressors, accommodate uncertainty and change, experiment to learn what will support resilience, and implement strategies to improve the ecosystems adaptive capacity (Mcleod et al., 2019). The authors of the study explain that the recommendations above can improve reef conservation efforts if implemented by policy frameworks to promote global change (Mcleod et al., 2019). This first solution to reviving coral reefs focuses on created new policies for reefs to help reefs recover.Many scientists are starting to believe that management systems, while necessary, may not be enough to save the reefs (Albright, 2018). Labs are now trying to reproduce and replant corals (Albright, 2018). Scientists are  using the fact that corals can reproduce asexually to their advantage by fragmenting corals to create a new coral to replant (Albright, 2018). The downside to simply fragmenting a coral for farming is that this can take a long time and a large amount of money to regrow reefs that have been there for centuries (Albright, 2018). But, Dr. Vaughan has found a much quicker strategy, what he calls “microfragmenting” (Morin, 2014). After accidently separating a few individual polyps from a coral, he found that after a week the polyps had stayed alive, and were doubled in size (Morin, 2014). This discovery allows him to make 1,00 microfragments in four days, dramatically increasing the speed of regrowing corals (Morin, 2014). Of 150 colonies grown from microfragments, 134 are flourishing, providing hope that this new method can help repopulate struggling reefs (Morin, 2014). While both management strategies and repopulating reefs can help recovering reefs, if oceans continue to warm, corals will continue to die (Albright, 2018). So, scientists are trying to assist evolution by creating adaptive corals more suitable to warmer oceans, enhancing genetic traits which improve resilience and recovery (Albright, 2018). Ruth Gates and Madeleine van Oppen have been working on enhancing stress resistance by exposing corals in a lab to extremely high temperatures to turn on genes that increase heat resistance (Albright, 2018). Their hope is that by transplanting these corals, offspring will inherit the same heat resistant genes, creating supercorals (Albright, 2018). Gates and van Oppen are also experimenting with selective breeding, and manipulating microbiome. A recent study on increasing coral resistance to bleaching by manipulating the microbiome, or the microorganisms in the coral, found that increased beneficial bacteria mitigated the effects of bleaching (Rosado et al., 2018). Scientists are hoping that a combination of selective breeding, epigenetic tuning, and microbiome manipulation will create a generation of adapted corals suited for rising sea temperatures (Albright, 2018). All of these current strategies provide a glimmer of hope for a bleak outlook on the future of coral reefs.
