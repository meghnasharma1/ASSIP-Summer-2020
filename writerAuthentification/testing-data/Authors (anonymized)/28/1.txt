Names are so intrinsic in our culture that we rarely give them a second thought. But what do they mean? Are they brands that are placed at birth, or windows into an individual’s soul and culture. From the time I was a young child, I certainly agreed with the former. My parents never forced Indian culture on me, and so my name felt like a foreign object. Something that I could never understand, only ponder. I can distinctly remember the first day in kindergarten, the first time someone had mispronounced my name. It was my teacher. She had said “Anand” harshly like she was in a hurry to get it out of her mouth. Instead of saying it with the soft letters that were supposed to be used, she said “A - nod”. At that moment, I was distraught. I began to question why I of all people was chosen to have such a difficult name. Why I had to stand out like a sore thumb in a sea of Bobs and Johns. After hearing “A - nod” for several years, I had become inured to the dread I felt whenever anyone tried to pronounce my name. However, that was before I understood the meaning my name held. To understand the story of my name, one must understand the story of my parents; Shashi Ramaka and Sunitha Mahavadi. 	Shashi Ramaka was born in 1970 to a wealthy family in a small town called Hanmakonda, in India. He lived with his two sisters, brother, mother, and father, an ideal family. His father, Dr. Lakshmanamurthy Ramaka a prominent doctor in the area, moved their entire family into a large building, surrounding all the smaller huts in the area. Lakshman was famous for giving treatments without even asking for money, influenced by his own impoverished upbringing. This garnered the family lots of attention, and my father grew up in the spotlight of the town, and the entire family. My father’s elder brother, Srinivas, began an aptitude for medicine that was only matched by his father. He was bright, clever, and got top scores in all his exams, proving to be a promising heir to Lakshman’s legacy. My father on the other hand, was none of those things. Growing up, he struggled to find courses he was interested in, as school was not his forte. However, there was one course that caught his eye, a relatively new field called computer science. He began to study it obsessively and neglected everything else in order to do so. This did not sit well with Lakshman, and he began to favor my uncle more and more, casting my father into obscurity. About 10 years later, Srinivas was a young cardiologist with his own hospital with numerous accolades to boot, while my father was an unemployed software engineer. My father, the black sheep of his family, needed to escape his stressful home life and set his sights on America, the land of opportunities. So, without his father’s blessing, he booked a flight to America. 	Sunitha Ramaka was born into a poor family in Hyderabad, India. She lived with many members of her extended family, including her sister, her uncles, aunts, and cousins, in a small, house with a dirt floor. To her family, her birthday didn’t matter. To them, it was just a number that signified her age, nothing else. It was so insignificant in fact, that she changed her birthday to one that was four months earlier, just so that she could start attending school earlier.Throughout her life, she faced numerous obstacles that hindered her progress as a student. Instead of studying, she was forced to do chores in order to keep the house in good shape. Throughout the night, my mother would study on the steps of her house, with only the moonlight illuminating her papers. She was determined and studied with a purpose. She had to escape the poor conditions she was living in and build a better life for everyone around her. Her parents, even in the most desperate conditions, supported her, as once she was out of the house and making money, she would be able to support them financially. Eventually her efforts paid off, and she was able to afford a plane ticket to the United States, where she met my father. 	My parents got married in India, and soon moved to America to start their new life. They decided on Manassas, Virginia, a small town close to DC, and a few years later I was born. Throughout their lives, my mother and father both faced struggles that hindered their success in life. However, through those struggles, they eventually prevailed and began to pour their heart and soul into the people that mattered the most in the world, their children. In a sense, they were living vicariously through me and my little sister and giving us the life, they could never have. Their biggest ambition in life was not money, or fame, but something much simpler. Something their lives always lacked. In that way, my name couldn’t have been more perfect. When translated from Sanskrit, the name Anand, means happiness.
