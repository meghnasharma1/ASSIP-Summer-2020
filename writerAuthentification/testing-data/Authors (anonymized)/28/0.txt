It seemed like a normal day in Chemistry; class hadn’t started yet and everyone was talking before Ms. Chhabra officially started the day’s lecture. Only a few noticed her walk to the strange machine situated on the table as she carefully set a metal sample inside of it. The sudden burst of sound we heard made our hearts race as the machine kept wailing without end. Ms. Chhabra exclaimed that the machine was called a Geiger counter, and produced a sharp beeping noise when bombarded with high-energy particles. Then, everyone in the class watched in amazement, as the beeping slowed and then stopped to halt once Ms. Chhabra placed a plate of lead in the Geiger counter. Certain materials, such as the lead in the radiation lab, have properties that allow them to absorb radiation that could be dangerous to humans. This is especially important in space, where astronauts lack any natural protection. For this reason, new shielding materials, as well as methods to predict the effective dose, are invaluable when protecting astronauts from deep space radiation.Since, the 1950s people have exited our atmosphere and today hundreds of astronauts have gone into space, however the dangers of space radiation are still not fully understood. On Earth, the dangers of this high energy radiation are becoming increasing clear, however, in space, these dangers are exacerbated without the natural protection of Earth’s atmosphere and its magnetic field. Deep space radiation consists of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar particle events (SPEs), and Van Allen Belts (radiation particles trapped around the Earth), with the most dangerous type being GCR. Recently, NASA has been experimenting with various materials in order to reduce the effective dose inside their space shuttles, because GCR may threaten future missions, including the 2025 flyby to Mars (NASA/Johnson Space Center, 2017).Parihar et al. (2016) conducted an experiment to study the harmful effects of space radiation by exposing numerous mice to the harmful radiation for 24 weeks and determined the effects of the radiation on the mice’s physical and mental state. To simulate galactic cosmic radiation the researchers used various charged particles, including 48Ti and 16O, that defines the spectrum of galactic cosmic radiation. The results that they found were astounding. They determined that the mice that were exposed to the dangerous radiation experienced memory impairments, decreased motor control, an increase in anxiety, and persistent neuroinflammation long after the exposure (Parihar et al., 2016). Additionally, Yin (2016) established a correlation between GCR exposure and recurring heart problems by bringing up how 3 out of 7 Apollo astronauts died of cardiovascular diseases. They also stated that mice that were exposed to cosmic radiation had damaged blood vessel linings, a sign of long-term heart disease (Yin, 2016).Next, Kartashov & Shurshakov (2018) tested a way to predict the effective dose the astronaut would have to endure in space. These researchers used a ray-tracing method to calculate radiation exposure levels of astronauts with different levels of shielding, using actual measurements from the MATROSHKA-R experiment (2004 to 2016) as a control set. This method is especially useful when exact compartment shielding geometry and radiation environment of the planned mission are not known. They tested three cases: one in the spherical phantom (in several ISS modules), one with a protective curtain, and one with both. In the end, they determined that their results had an 85% accuracy (15% off from target data) and that their method was usable to calculate future radiation in the ISS (Kartashov & Shurshakov, 2018).Lastly, Barthel and Sarigul-Klijn (2018) used a simulation of a 500 day Mars flyby (a computer program) to measure how different quantities of radiation affected humans with different amounts of shielding. They wanted to study the effect of different HZE (high charge and energy) ions on both aluminum and HDPE (high-density polyethylene). They determined that the effective dose was higher with aluminum and that silicon ions need to be specially prepared for, because they are absorbed differently by the body. Another important observation made during this experiment was that the effective dose increased after 80 g/cm2, which shows that after a certain point, making the shielding thicker will decrease the effectiveness of the radiation shielding. The researchers determined that 40-80 g/cm2 of HDPE was optimal for shielding, but more than currently being tested in NASA (Barthel & Sarigul-Klijn, 2018). J. Barthel (personal communication, February 7, 2019), my scientist correspondent, stated another material being considered for shielding was liquid hydrogen, however more liquid hydrogen would be required to shield the same amount of radiation as HDPE. Additionally, he added that 80 g/cm2 was the best thickness for shielding for human safety, however, costs must be considered, as increasing the thickness of shielding can greatly increase total costs (J. Barthel, personal communication, February 7, 2019).With the increase of global warming, the decrease in natural resources, and the increase of pollution in densely populated cities, humans may have to colonize in the distant future. However, that dream cannot be realized due to the dangerous effects of GCRs that harm our astronauts every day they are in outer space. In the immediate future, finding optimum shielding materials and fully understanding the effects of GCRs is essential to protect all the astronauts currently living in the ISS, and future astronauts that one day hope to fly past Mars. One obstacle that I anticipate having is documenting the effects of GCRs because many of these effects are long-term and may be hard to predict. Additionally, the different shielding materials are difficult to test without data from the ISS or similar simulations.         	What started as a small curiosity with the radiation lab in Chemistry, has evolved into a passion of mine. As previously stated, methods to calculate the effective dose astronauts would have to endure in space, and then, based on that using the appropriate amount and position of shielding is paramount to protect our astronauts from the long-term effects of GCRs. With the planned 2025 flyby to Mars it becomes important, now more than ever, that we find better ways to shield all the astronauts in space from harmful radiation. In the future, the full effects of GCR needs to be determined, and more effective shielding that blocks all the predicted radiation should be used.
