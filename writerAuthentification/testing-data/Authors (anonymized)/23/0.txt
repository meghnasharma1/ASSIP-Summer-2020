8,000 milesMy father looks upon the down payment papers he just signed, relief washing over his face. My mother, ever the rock-solid support behind him, has a hint of pride in her smile. The house they’d just bought – their first -- was more than just a home. It was the aggregate of their struggles, the fruits of their labors, the capstone of a journey that began thirty years earlier.        	My father’s journey began in a tiny village in India and he was the tragic kind of poor where he only owned two sets of clothes, washing one when he wore the other. He tells me that the hardship motivated him to get out and make a better life, but I know his poverty-stricken childhood was not a gift. He worked hard in school, mathematics as his forte, and eventually found work as an engineer. It was soon after this that he met my mother.        	My mother’s family was comparatively wealthy, but she faced struggles of her own. In India, those who believed in conservative values and the elderly fought fiercely against the progressiveness of the ‘90s, and gender equality was no different. No matter how much you excelled in school or how high-paying a job you had, girls were expected to shift their focuses to the household after marriage. She got a master’s degree in physics and became a schoolteacher, one of the few occupations where women were common.           	Arranged marriage was, and still is, part of the bedrock of Indian society, tying in quite nicely with the cherished principles of respect for your elders and duty to family. It was no surprise that my parents were brought together this way. My brother was born in 1997 and here their journey merges with those of the thousands of other recently wed Indian couples looking to emigrate from India. They knew that for their children to have a shot at a better life, India would not cut it. They had to leave.        	The decision to immigrate to the US was an excruciating one. They left their families, their homes, their friends, and everything they had grown up in to travel 8,000 miles to a foreign country for nothing but a wistful thought. They arrived with their treasured possessions, a small amount of cash, and a lot of hope. Thankfully, they had chosen California right around the tech boom, so finding work was no issue. They worked and they saved, but life in the US was far from perfect.        	For one, racism was an issue in the workplace. This sort of discrimination was novel and unexpected, as they were the ethnic majority in India and didn’t have any experience dealing with it. But they pushed through, ignoring the comments and focusing on getting the job done.        	The separation from their families hit them especially hard around this time, as they were thousands of miles away and could only call them, video calling having not yet become ubiquitous. In India’s highly familial culture, your relatives are the first and the last people you turn to for assistance or problems of any kind, and it is common for children to live with their parents far past 18 to take care of them. My parents’ shunning of this duty weighed heavily on them, and they made frequent trips back as if to absolve themselves.        	The moment they signed the down payment was a moment of glorious triumph, proving that their efforts had finally borne fruit. But their journey wasn’t over. The real challenge lay ahead: raising me and my brother and giving us the better life they had emigrated for. We moved to Virginia for the high-quality education system, packing up for a second time and leaving the new life they had built over the years behind.        	My parents tried to teach me and my brother the lessons they learned on their journey in an attempt to prepare us for what we’d face as adults. But we won’t face nearly as many struggles. Not even close. We simply don’t have the sheer magnitude of obstacles to overcome that my parents did, thanks to their Herculean efforts to overcome what they were born into and give us a new life.        	My parents’ journey, on the surface, was a mere 8,000 mile flight. But it was more than that – it was their struggles, their perseverance, and their sacrifices. It is a journey shared by millions of immigrants that come to the US every year. All so that people like me, the children of those immigrants, can have better lives than they did. Hopefully I live up to it.773 words
