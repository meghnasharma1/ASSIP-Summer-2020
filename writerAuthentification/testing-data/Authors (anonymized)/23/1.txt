The clock showed 1:30 AM and I was frantically googling bond angles and polarity, trying to finish the 50-point molecular chart due that day. It was only as I was placing the finishing touches that I had a moment to admire the beautiful patterns in the structures I had drawn. Due to my frayed mental state at the time, I went no further into that train of thought. After a few hours of sleep, however, I got to wondering how the different shapes and patterns I had drawn affected the properties of the materials themselves. This led me in to my research topic - how can we better design materials to be more architecturally tolerant?	Traditional architectural materials are only a fraction as strong as they could be due to defects that inevitably occur in the manufacturing process (University of Pennsylvania, 2019). These defects can then cause roofs to collapse, bridges to buckle, and buildings to simply fall apart. While previous developments in building materials focused on simply finding better combinations or alloys to improve strength, today’s materials scientists are using additive manufacturing (3d printing) to construct vastly superior ‘architected materials.’ The fine control enabled by additive manufacturing allows the construction of nearly defect-less, specialized materials. 	Cutting-edge researchers in this field have taken a broad variety of approaches in their research. One potential route that immediately comes to mind is looking to nature for inspiration. After all, structures found in nature like bone and nacre are amazing examples of architected materials. Rosewitz, Cholasi, and Rahbar (2019) found that bio-inspired architected composites made by casting cement mortar with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), a thermoplastic, were significantly superior to their traditional counterparts. They had a higher load limit, withstood cracks for longer, and required more pressure to break after cracks had formed. The researchers used additive manufacturing to create the architected composites, a common technique among current materials scientists. Their work has direct applications in architecture, but the cost of the ABS and speed of the additive manufacturing may prohibit large scale adoption at the moment.Pham, Liu, Todd, and Lertthanasarn (2019) at the Imperial College in London also looked to nature and wondered if the known metallurgical strengthening mechanisms found in natural crystals could be applied to architected materials. Through their testing of various mechanisms, including grain-boundary, precipitation, and multi-phase strengthening, they found that each had its own benefits. For example, multi-phase hardening enables lattices with high energy absorption, which is useful in certain architectural applications but not others. I reached out to the lead researcher, and he asserted that precipitation hardening would be the most effective way to increase the strength of the overall structure for architectural applications (Minh S Pham, personal communication, February 7, 2019). However, he added that each application is unique in terms of its specific property needs, so the other strengthening mechanisms also had potential uses.The properties of a material determine its value in architecture and the situations where it is applicable. In natural materials, certain properties are nearly always exclusive - flexibility with strength, strength with toughness, and dissipativeness with stiffness. However, researchers at the State University of New York have designed architected materials that possess combinations of properties normally exclusive in traditional materials (Jia, Yu, Hou, & Wang, 2019). They accomplished this feat by integrating microstructures in the additive manufacturing process. Meanwhile, other researchers with a similar goal have done something even more impressive (University of Pennsylvania, 2019). They’ve managed to create a sheet of nickel with tiny, nanometer pores that is as strong as titanium but several times lighter. Although its strength alone merits its use in architecture, it serves the dual purpose of functioning as a battery if anodes and cathodes fill the empty spaces in it. The possibilities sparked by these researchers are endless. Minh-Son Pham, for one, is working on discovering new properties through unique combinations of atomic lattices and integrated microstructures (Minh S Pham, personal communication, February 7, 2019). His research could result in materials that could make architectural failure almost nonexistent. Since additive manufacturing is the most common method for creating architected materials in current research, one must wonder as to how developments in the printing process itself will change the field. Given that future 3d printers may be able to create thousands of different properties in architected materials, the world as we know it could be revolutionized with materials custom made to their purpose, with no useless or counterproductive properties that could impede architectural stability (Kadic, Milton, Hecke, & Wegener, 2019).These researchers are finding solutions in a field in which every innovation has an immediate practical application. The work they do results in better, safer materials that save lives every day. One aspect that keeps these materials in the development phase is their prohibitive cost and speed. Due to the slow process of additive manufacturing and the sometimes high cost of materials, these innovative architected materials remain in the laboratory. However, through advances in additive manufacturing, future research into innovative techniques, and hopefully a decrease in cost, we may soon see these novel materials integrated into our daily lives. The result will be a safer, more efficient world for all of us. Although at the time I wasn’t happy about staying up until 1:30 filling out the molecular chart, now I realize that what I was doing wasn’t just mindless busywork - it was a scaled down version of real research that has a concrete impact on the world.
