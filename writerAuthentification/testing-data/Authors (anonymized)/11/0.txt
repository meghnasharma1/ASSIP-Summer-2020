At first glance, the emission spectra lab isn’t the most exciting chemistry lab. There are no bubbling gases, explosions, or flames. In the emission spectra lab, a tube of hydrogen or neon gas is made to glow by passing a current through it. When a diffraction grating is placed over this light source, the light splits into distinct, bright lines corresponding to specific wavelengths of light. These are emission lines, formed by electrons moving between specific energy levels in an atom’s electron shells. Which is all very interesting, but I was bored by a lab that boils down to squinting at a neon light for half an hour. However, as I learned more about the topic of emission spectra, I began to realize how important they actually were. That small, flickering tube of hydrogen had connections to powerful techniques in analytical chemistry.One of these techniques is laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, or LIBS, was first used in 1963, three years after the development of laser technology (Radziemski & Cremers, 2013). In LIBS, a laser is used to vaporize a small part of a sample. This turns part of the sample into a plasma similar to the plasma observed in our chemistry lab. The spectrum of this plasma is recorded and used to determine the elemental composition of the sample. LIBS has a wide range of uses, most prominently in the Mars rover Curiosity’s ChemCam experiment. It has been shown to work underwater and from distances of up to 45 feet (Radziemski & Cremers, 2013). One of its most important uses, however, is in monitoring the health of concrete.<I’m not sure if any of these scientists will respond, so I’ve sent emails to all of them. None have written back yet, so I’m not sure where I’ll put the scientist correspondence.>Researchers at Masaryk University in the Czech Republic developed a method in 2018 using LIBS to determine the concentration of sulfur in concrete (Hrdlička et al., 2018). While sulfur is found in cement naturally, excessive amounts can attack the concrete chemically, weakening it. These researchers used calibration pellets composed of synthetic limestone intermixed with varying amounts of sodium sulfate. <I’ve emailed these researchers about why this calibration method is accurate; their response, if any, may be inserted here.> The emission lines of sulfur are heavily absorbed by normal air, so the researchers needed a helium atmosphere. Nevertheless, by comparing these results with results from a different procedure known as inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), these researchers found LIBS could be effectively used to determine the amount of sulfur in a sample of concrete (Hrdlička et al., 2018).While the Hrdlička study was aimed at using LIBS to measure sulfur in concrete, other researchers have used LIBS to determine the strength of concrete. Traditional methods of determining concrete strength require extraction and destruction of a core sample, thus limiting their use. Researchers at the Benha Faculty of Engineering in Egypt have found a method of measuring this strength using LIBS. These researchers found a linear relationship between the compressive strength of a concrete sample and the ratio between the intensity of two calcium lines (ElFaham, Okil, & Nagy, 2018). The stronger the concrete was, the brighter the ionized calcium line was. They postulate that this is because stronger concrete absorbs more energy from the laser and is ionized more frequently (ElFaham, Okil, & Nagy, 2018). As a result, the ratio between the two lines can be used to measure the strength of concrete. LIBS is mostly non-destructive, as only a small portion of the concrete is vaporized. It requires less preparation than conventional methods, while still delivering an accurate reading of the compressive strength.Yet another use of LIBS is measuring the concentration of chloride. Like sulfur, chloride in cement causes corrosion and wear away at concrete. In reinforced concrete, it interacts with the iron in rebar, causing corrosion, pitting, and cracks (Abbas et al., 2018). This is a particular danger for concrete exposed to salt water or road salts. However, chlorine’s spectral lines are faint, barely detectable even with specialized equipment. Rather than detecting the emission lines of chlorine, researchers at the University of Applied Sciences in Germany attempted to measure the emission lines of molecules formed from chlorine (Dietz, Klose, Kohns, & Ankerhold, 2019). They chose CaCl because chlorine is found in the cement component of concrete, which is composed mostly of calcium. CaCl emission was highly unstable between measurements due to irregularities in cement content. Therefore, the researchers averaged 20 measurements and took the ratio of the emissions from CaCl to those from CaO, which does not contain chlorine (Dietz, Klose, Kohns, & Ankerhold, 2019). With these measures in place, the researchers found that the amount and spatial distribution of chlorine in a concrete sample can be determined without special equipment, such as a helium atmosphere or high-power spectrometers (Dietz, Klose, Kohns, & Ankerhold, 2019). This research is significant because maintenance of concrete is important from an economic and ecological standpoint. Concrete is one of the most common building materials in the world, but requires significant cost and energy to create. Therefore, regularly maintaining concrete is critical. Sulfur content, chloride content, and compressive strength are important measurements of how far a piece of concrete has degraded. Normal methods for measuring these parameters require a core sample be drilled and crushed. This takes time, is expensive, and, in the case of chloride measurements, provides insufficient data on how far the chloride has seeped into the concrete. LIBS provides a faster and cheaper way of monitoring the health of concrete. In the case of compressive strength measurements, no core sampling is required (ElFaham, Okil, & Nagy, 2018). In the case of chlorine and sulfur, LIBS requires less preparation and delivers more distribution information than conventional chemical methods (Dietz, Klose, Kohns, & Ankerhold, 2019). LIBS has the potential to make monitoring of concrete cheaper, faster, and more reliable. This will have benefits for the economy, for the environment, and for safety.As I read these papers, one particular thing gave me pause. Most of them made mention of using the hydrogen Balmer-alpha line to determine the electron density. This was critical for calibrating their measurements. The value they gave for the wavelength of this line was 656.27 nm. I recognized the value, because I’d calculated it in the emission lab. At the time, it had just seemed like one more random fact about chemistry to memorize. Of course, there are no random facts. In the course of doing this project, I learned that what we do in chemistry is connected to important topics in analytical chemistry and materials science.
