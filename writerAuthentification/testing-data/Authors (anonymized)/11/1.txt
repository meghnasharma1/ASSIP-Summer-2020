My parents aren’t your stereotypical Asian parents. They didn’t have unrealistic expectations for me and they didn’t fly into a rage at the slightest transgression. In many ways I feel lucky to have such understanding parents. They were strict when I was failing, when I was in middle school, didn’t care about homework, and forgot or outright ignored assignments. They wanted me to have a sense of responsibility. That’s the only thing they were ever really mad about. I remember them berating me when I didn’t focus on my work. They told me about how when they were young, they had to be dragged away from their books when it got too late. They said they tied their hair up to the roof, so when they fell asleep, and their head dropped, it would yank them back awake. I remembered that. I remembered that and for the next two years I thought about that. Every day I wished that I could be like them. Every day, I wished that someday, I would get to the point of being addicted to work. Of having to be forced off it because I wanted it so much.The big thing at my middle school was Science Olympiad. Everyone talked about it. It was an academic competition, a team of thirty people who would represent our school on the national stage. Who competed by memorizing facts about the Earth and building machines out of rubber bands. It sounded stupid, it sounded petty, it sounded foolish, even, but it was worth so much more for that. It sounded so challenging. It sounded so hard, so devious, almost, that I placed it as the highest ambition in my mind.I remember their coach, Mrs. Boomer, a tall and spectacled woman, laying down the rules at an interest meeting. Warning us that it would take a lot out of us. Telling us that if we joined, we couldn’t be in any other club or activity because it would distract us. I remember asking the older kids, who had done it the year before, how it was. I remembered asking them when they found time to do their homework. They told me they did their homework while walking from class to class, and studied for tests on the bus ride home. I remember that some competitions demanded that they bring in only one sheet of notes for reference. I remembered all my classmates squinting, looking at pages and pages of dense, eye-blurring text, printed almost so small as to be illegible, because they had to save space.I remember them complaining about having to stay up all night, day after day, to juggle all the things they did - complaining, but to me it sounded like bragging, bragging about how far they’d go to do what they loved. There was a level of desperation in their actions, a level I’d never imagined, that they talked about so casually. What they did every day were things I never considered doing, things I’d have thought were too hard for me. It horrified me, to a degree. It also filled me with awe. I thought, as many people did, that so much of what they did was extraneous, so much rote memorization and obsessive refinement, but that only further elevated my opinion of them.I think at a certain point I knew I didn’t deserve to get in. I think that’s why I didn’t. I think I knew I would balk at the lengths they went to win, that I wouldn’t be willing to throw away everything for their victory, as they demanded. I think even before I was rejected, I knew I wouldn’t be able to do it, that I couldn’t stick through the things they had faced. I never did do Science Olympiad. I tried in 7th, 8th, and 9th grade. I was rejected every time.And it hounded me. For the next two years, I would pour out effusive, unwanted praise for those in Science Olympiad, and I was shocked whenever they implied I was intelligent in the slightest way. Because I didn’t understand why people that had won, that had done so much and gone so far, would even think someone like me was worth anything. I felt like those who had everything deserved to be told just how great they were. I couldn’t fathom how they would lack for anything, how they could feel any unhappiness whatsoever when they were doing what they were doing, flying rockets and building bridges and coming back all together, boasting of victories in places miles away, in Ohio, in Wisconsin. They were, and still are, some of my closest friends, but now they were more, in some way. For two years I spent every day bemoaning my inability to get on that team. For two years I went to sleep every night sobbing at all the things I missed, dreaming of what they had done, what they were doing, what they could do. For two years, my every move was colored by the nagging idea that nothing I did could compare to what they had already done.It took time for me to realize I was wrong. It took time, and guidance from my parents and my friends. One time, one of the “SO kids” told me that over a year, the only time they actually skipped sleep was when they decided to throw a party. Another time my dad said their results didn’t mean anything. That they bragged about building things, but it was really the teachers who build, and the kids just memorize it. I realized that what I’d judged as hard work may not have been such a big deal for them. That many of the people did Science Olympiad not for a love of science, but because their parents forced them to, or because they wanted to use it as a springboard for getting into a prestigious high school.The stories we tell ourselves can influence us more than we know. Tell someone a story, and they could build their life around it. They could dream dreams for that story. They could labor for years for that story. Stories are the seeds of our imagination. They define the limits of what we can do and what we should do. Tell the wrong story and you get the wrong image. Tell the wrong story and everything you do, everything you try, will be wrong. In middle school I listened to the wrong stories. I told myself accounts of others that weren’t true, that puffed up and warped my view of the world, and I paid for it.It was just about a month ago when I asked my parents about that particular story again. I was upset about something, some test or grade or some mistake, something else small enough that I don’t remember it anymore. It played out as it always does. I insisted I had done something irredeemably wrong, and late at night my parents tried to assure me that there’s nothing to worry about because nobody’s perfect. I shot back that they were, that they must be perfect, they that had to be dragged away from their books by their parents and they that tied their hair to the roof so they could work without sleeping.They laughed. Both of them stood in the door to my room and laughed. You must have misheard that, they said. That stuff about tying your hair to the roof, that’s just an old Chinese fable, they told me. We never meant it was something we did. It’s just something all parents tell their children, to inspire them to focus on their studies. We heard the same thing when we were young, but we all knew it was a myth. Nobody’s really like that.
