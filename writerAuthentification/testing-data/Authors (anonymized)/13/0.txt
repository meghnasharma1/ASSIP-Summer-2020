I really did not feel like writing this story. Just one more Youtube video. Just one more round of a video game. Just one more activity before the onslaught of homework and projects.When I was younger, I had fewer responsibilities. I only needed to attend elementary school and perform some chores. The majority of my free time was spent playing outside with friends in the fresh air and clear skies. If it was a rainy day, I would be watching TV or playing on my computer. I had minimal homework and no stress. Middle school was about the same. I received some more homework and more intensive projects, but nothing that was time consuming or intensive. I still had lots of time to hang out with my friends and play games before finishing my homework. The continuation of this behavior eventually led to my bad habits today.Fast forward to the first day of high school. I walked in through the doors of my school. Every other freshman was also wandering around trying to find their classes. It was a different place, a place of new and unique experiences. I had the same mindset as many others, to put my fullest effort into all of my classes and spend all of my time learning. However, after a few weeks, I started caving into my previous habits from middle school. Spending 100 percent of my time and effort on school just was not going to work.At first, it was just a few videos to destress from the burden of homework and projects. However, this slowly turned into an avalanche of procrastination. One video turned to two. Two videos turned to three, three to four, and so on. Soon I would realize that it was 10 PM and I still had nothing finished. I also remembered how much fun video games were. They were exceedingly more fun than school projects. As I slowly got back into gaming, the more I pushed back my responsibilities. It would be wonderful to have no responsibilities, no accountability, and have nothing due. But that is just not how the world works.That was the lowest point I have ever hit. Freshmen year is not even close to being the hardest year either! Every day was a late night or an early morning. I was tired in class and struggled to learn. My grades reflected my condition as well. I was not at rock bottom, but I was pretty dang close. Returning to my base school started to seem like a great idea. There was less homework, less stress, and it was easier overall. However, this clashed with the original reason why I came to this school. I wanted to expand my knowledge and experience things I would never receive anywhere else.I slowly came to realize that something needed to change; that this habit could not continue. I needed to rethink how I did things. This was not the fault of the amount of work; there was more work than other schools but it was still manageable. This was not the fault of the tests; the tests were harder and required a higher level of understanding but it was still manageable. This was not the fault of the teachers; the teachers were all supportive and wanted only the best for each student. This was my fault. I only have 24 hours in a day, and so does everyone else. I needed to figure out how to manage my time correctly and be efficient.This time I did not make the same mistake as I made at the beginning of the year. It is not possible to learn every single waking minute. But I also could not waste every single minute on games and videos. It is a balancing act, something that is hard to perfect. Something that to this day, in the second quarter of my sophomore year, still has not been perfected. Every day when I come home after school sports, I still have an itch to watch videos or play a game. Somedays I give in to the slight itch, but not to the same extent of freshman year. I have significantly improved my studying habits from last year. I get more sleep and have a much better learning experience overall. I am starting to understand why this school is so special. The friends that I have made, the experiences, and writing this story are things that will have a lasting impact for me. I still procrastinated before writing this story, my story. But I am getting much better.
