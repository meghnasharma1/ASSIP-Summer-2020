Curiosity is a trait which is ingrained in the human mind. Ever since the prehistoric humans left the wilderness of Africa to explore new lands, we have spread to Europe, Asia, and across the ocean to the Americas. In the 1960s we flew all the way to the moon. Technology has been exponentially advancing in the past centuries, allowing us to achieve new and exciting feats. Mankind has always yearned to reach for the stars, and we will soon have the capability to satiate this hunger. However, there are many challenges. One major hurdle is the amount of radiation that we would be exposed to during space travel. Similar to the Radiation Lab we conducted during chemistry class, certain materials such as lead can have a profound effect on the amount of radiation received.	In the near future, there will be humans setting foot on Mars. However, the amount of radiation that astronauts would be exposed to on a trip to Mars would be several hundred times larger than someone on Earth in the same time period and at least 60% of the recommended amount of radiation for an astronaut’s entire career (Europlanet, 2018). Radiation in space is mainly composed of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events (Chancellor, et al., 2018). Galactic Cosmic Rays ions originate from outside the solar system and possess enough energy to penetrate any current shielding technology (Chancellor, et al., 2018). The GCR spectrum contributes to the chronic, background radiation exposure during long durations in space, while Solar Particle Events occur in short high-energy bursts (Chancellor, et al., 2018). Due to the lack of effective methods for shielding astronauts from radiation, many other materials have been tested.	One potential candidate for use in radiation shielding is asteroidal material. In a study conducted by Pohl and Britt (2017), the effectiveness of CL and CM chondrites was compared to aluminum. Aluminum is the typical space construction material as it is lightweight, malleable, and lower cost (Pohl & Britt, 2017). One major flaw with many materials such as aluminum is that radiations doses actually significantly increase after a certain thickness (Slaba et al., 2017). This is caused by a neutron build-up in the shielding geometry as the ions from GCR strike the material (Slaba et al., 2017). For example, after an aluminum thickness of 20 g/cm2, the radiation doses significantly increase (Slaba et al., 2017). One advantage of CM and CL carbonaceous chondrites over aluminum is that they contain water (Pohl & Britt, 2017). Hydrogenated materials lessen nuclear fragmentation and therefore reduces radiation doses (Narici et al., 2017). The results from the experiment showed that the CM Murchison and the CL Orgueil chondrites have better shielding properties than aluminum (Pohl & Britt, 2017). (Quote about applications of chondrites will be inserted here) These chondrites could be utilized as radiation shielding by layering it between more structurally stable materials.	Polyethylene is widely used as radiation shielding in space and also the most commonly used plastic in the world (Narici et al., 2017). In a study done by Narici et al. (2017), the effectiveness of using Kevlar as radiation shielding is examined and compared to Polyethylene. Both materials are highly hydrogenated, which resists nuclear fragmentation and lowers radiation dosage amounts (Narici et al., 2017). The results from the study show that Kevlar has a dose reduction rate of 55 ± 4%, which is very similar to Polyethylene (Narici et al., 2017). Kevlar also has high impact resistance and adaptability (Narici et al., 2017). Because it is a fabric, it can be utilized in Extra-Vehicular Activity suits and well as extra shielding in certain areas of a spacecraft (Narici et al., 2017).	Another material that has a high potential for radiation shielding is a polyvinyl alcohol/iron oxide polymer composite. In a study conducted by Srinivasan and Samuel (2017), they calculated the radiological properties of a polyvinyl alcohol/iron oxide polymer composite. Iron oxides such as hematite and magnetite are commonly used materials for shielding against radiation (Srinivasan & Samuel, 2017). Polymer composites also provide good shielding when mixed with high atomic number materials (Srinivasan & Samuel, 2017). Polyvinyl alcohol/iron oxide polymer composite is also hydrogenated which protects against nuclear defragmentation (Srinivasan & Samuel, 2017). The results of the study show that the PVA/iron oxide polymer composite had superior properties with a 0.5% concentration of magnetite (Srinivasan & Samuel, 2017). 	With the current known materials and methods of radiation shielding, the dose reduction is not enough for interplanetary travel to Mars. Some limitations include the weight and cost of materials. It is also not possible to make the shielding as thick as we want, as nuclear defragmentation increases radiation doses after a certain thickness. There are also many limitations in predicting space radiation risk as most of the limits are not fully defined (Chancellor, et al., 2018). This means that the 3% Risk of Exposure-Induced Death may not be conservative enough because of the incomplete data (Chancellor, et al., 2018). There are many planned space flights to Mars in the near future by organizations such as NASA and SpaceX. However, much more research will be required before these plans can be realized. There will need to be more conclusive data on the effect of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events on the health of astronauts, as well as much more radiation shielding materials. Mankind’s dream of reaching for the stars is only just around the corner.
