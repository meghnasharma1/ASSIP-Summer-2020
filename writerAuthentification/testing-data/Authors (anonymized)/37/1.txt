Beep! Beep! Beep! I watched in fascination as the Geiger Counter detected radiation the human eye could not perceive. As my teacher moved the cesium plate closer to the radiation detector I attentively listened as the beeping increased. Then, all of a sudden the room went dead silent. My teacher had placed a small piece of lead in between the cesium plate and the Geiger Counter. This tiny, ⅛ inch lead had almost entirely blocked all the radiation coming from the cesium plate. This was captivating to me, the fact that radiation could be blocked or shielded from. That's when I realized this is exactly what the ozone layer does. It shields us from radiation coming from the sun. However, in the past century, there has been a decrease in the total amount of ozone available in the stratosphere and without this ozone, there would be nothing to block the radiation from reaching us. 	The ozone layer prevents harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching the surface of the Earth. A decrease in ozone would lead to dangerous effects to the cells of all life forms on Earth, it would also harm cell organelles and indirectly affect metabolic processes (Prasad, Kakani, & Reddy, 2017). In addition, the destruction of ozone could lead to humans being more susceptible to diseases such as skin cancer and cataracts (Kolirin, 2018). According to Prasad et al. (2017), ozone itself is made of three oxygen atoms. It is chlorofluorocarbons, also known as CFCs, that cause the depletion of ozone. CFCs are made of chlorine, fluorine, and carbon atoms and are mostly found in air conditioners, refrigerators, and aerosol can propellants among other things. When CFCs reach the upper stratosphere, UV radiation breaks them down to form chlorine atoms. This chlorine reacts with ozone and breaks it down to form chloride and oxygen. The chloride then breaks down again, forming a chlorine atom and an oxygen atom. These newly formed chlorine atoms are now free to break down more ozone molecules. CFC emissions amount to about 80% of all ozone depletion (Prasad et al., 2017). Which is why the Montreal Protocol was drafted and signed in 1987 to stop the product, import, and export of all ozone-depleting substances including CFCs and halocarbons. If this protocol is followed the ozone layer should fully heal in 50 years (Kolirin, 2018). Since 2000, the ozone layer has recovered at a rate of 1-3% per decade. However, Kolirin (2018) reported that the scientists at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported a sharp rise in CFCs from an unknown substance since May 2018. If the substance is not found and regulated this could be detrimental to the healing process of the ozone layer. 	Morales-Méndez & Silva-Rodríguez (2018) conducted a study to find the effects of the manufacture of plastic bags on the depletion of the ozone layer. The study they conducted focused on a plant located in northern Columbia. They determined the gasses emitted to find their contribution to the depletion of the ozone layer. They then took a quantitative measurement of matter and energy flows for all inputs and outputs of the production process of plastic bags. In the end, they concluded that printing of plastic bags is the second biggest contributor to global warming just behind extrusion (Morales-Méndez & Silva-Rodríguez, 2018). They conducted this study because plastics are manufactured with the use of organic and inorganic compounds such as pigments, antioxidants, and stabilizers among other things. The pigments used in plastic bag production use heavy metals such as lead and cadmium. The antioxidants and stabilizers are compounds used to protect the plastic bags during the production process from thermal decomposition. However, these industrial compounds have the ability to bond without other elements to form compounds such as chlorides, oxides, and sulfides. These compounds all contribute to ozone depletion. 	Another study conducted by Singh & Bhargawa (2018) examined the past and present trends of ozone depletion. It analyzed 52 years of ozone depletion data using the Box-Jenkins model, in order to predict future trends until the year 2030. Using the Box-Jenkins the study also determined how much ozone-depleting substances contribute to the concentration of the ozone layer. From this research, Singh & Bhargawa (2018) concluded that the present atmospheric abundance of chlorine and bromine is about 3325 and 14.3 parts per trillion. The study then concluded that these numbers would change to 3217 and 13.1 parts per trillion respectively. The research that was done in the study also helped conclude that by the year 2030 ozone levels will be similar to how they were before the 1980s.  The last study was conducted by Krzyścin & Baranowski (2019) and it created a new statistical model to determine total ozone trend variability by analyzing the trends of the total ozone available in the atmosphere in recent years. The study concludes that total ozone change since 1979 can be described in three stages. The first stage shows the ozone decline period created by the increase in ozone depletion substances. The second stage describes the recovery phase after ozone-depleting substances were overturned. Finally, the last stage displays the newest trends, which is mainly just a leveling off in the recovery of the ozone layer. This helped create the new trend model which consists of three joined or independent straight lines, each of which describes one stage of the long term ozone variability (Krzyścin & Baranowski, 2019). 	I wanted to learn more about the reaction between ozone-depleting substances and ozone molecules in order to draw conclusions to what alternative substances could be used in place of ozone-depleting substances. So I contacted Jonathan-David Morales-Méndez, from Universidad Manuela Beltrán in Columbia. I asked him questions regarding the actual reaction that takes places between CFCs and halocarbons with ozone molecules. I also asked him about the equations that could be used to model this reaction. In addition, I asked him what other actions need to be taken to increase the rate of ozone recovery. He has not yet responded to my questions. If ozone-depleting substance use can be properly regulated the ozone layer should successfully recover in the future. However, the recovery of the ozone layer is very slow and fragile. All it takes is one unknown substance to stop this healing process and once again start the process of ozone depletion. Therefore the subject of ozone depletion is incredibly relevant and important and more research needs to be done to find alternatives to ozone-depleting substances and to monitor the level of ozone present in the atmosphere.
