Euphoria. That's the feeling I usually have when sitting on a plane. It might sound strange, but my favorite part of traveling is the feeling I get while flying to and from my destination. Even turbulence makes me excited with the way the normally smooth air turns choppy, making the plane rise and fall in unexpected ways. But even after all this exhilaration, something felt very off as I landed in Kochin Airport in the summer of 2018. The moment flight EK532 had landed a wave of uneasiness had run over me, but I brushed it off since I was generally an anxious person. Immediately after arriving in Kerala things began to go wrong. For weeks before our arrival, never-ending rain had devastated the southern state of India causing massive flooding. But, only after my father, brother, and I arrived did the worst of it come. As soon as our flight arrived the rain can down stronger, so strong in fact that my grandfather who lived five minutes from the airport could not come to pick us up like he usually did, and the flight which arrived right after ours slipped on the wet runway, which ended up causing the airport to close. This caused a whole new group of worries such as if my cousins who were planning on flying in later that afternoon would be able to arrive and if the airport would even open in time for us to fly back the next week. We tried to be sanguine and just enjoy the fact that we were in my parent's homeland. After arriving at my grandfather's house, my dad decided that he was willing to risk the five-hour journey to get to his parent’s house. His dad had already sent down a driver to take us, but the only problem was that most of the roads were closed due to flooding and if we wanted to get to his house in Pathanamthitta, a small village inside of Kerela, it would take an additional two hours. Throughout the journey we arrived at the road after road, only have to turn around after stopping to talk to a local person to get directions and finding out that the road we wanted to travel on was closed. We eventually did end up making it to Pathanamthitta, but if we had left even an hour later we would have been stuck on a road somewhere with no way to go forward or backward. The first few days of our vacation were blissful. Even though it was raining heavily, my grandparent's house was elevated enough that flooding was not a problem. We were able to go visit all of my extended family, go to the movies, and go shopping. Meanwhile, the rest of Kerela was being devastated. People were unable to leave their house and had lost electricity, they had no way to pump water into their wells, no way to get food, and no way to contact anyone for help once their phones lost power. One of my closest friends even lost her grandmother after not being able to breathe when her ventilator shut down after losing power. Things never did get that bad for us, and for that I’m grateful. However, we did end up losing power about three days into our visit. Though my grandfather had an inverter and a generator, which allowed us to stay connected until we got power back again. Eventually, the rains slowed down and we got power back. That Sunday we went to church as a family. Standing next to my grandmother while praying I began to feel light head headed like I was about to fall. I decided not to say anything because I knew better than to bother my grandmother with my silly problems. As a survivor of breast cancer, my grandmother was my idol and everything I did in life was with her in mind. However, this ended up not being the appropriate decision since when I fainted, I  interrupted the prayers of all the people around me. After regaining consciousness I knew this was a sign. In the past, every time I had fainted other traumatizing events had followed consecutively. But, instead of taking this as a warning to be careful I decided to just ignore it and hope for the best.The next day I decided I wanted to learn how to drive. Being 15 and 3 months old I hadn’t yet gotten my permit back at home in Virginia, but I was determined that India was the best place to learn with its wet, small, winding roads. Convincing my dad was easy, I just told him that once he got back home and I got my permit he wouldn’t have time to teach me the basics so we might as well start here. Taking my grandfathers old Maruti Suzuki, he took me to a road nearby and taught me how to drive using the stick shift. The first day went well, I drove relatively well and nothing unpleasant occurred. It was the following day when trouble struck. I still remember this moment with incredible vividness. I was driving up a road when we came to an intersection. My dad didn’t want me to stop since I had a hard time starting the car up using the clutch, so he told me to turn right. At that moment an auto rickshaw appeared heading right for where I was going to turn into. Not wanting for us to crash my dad turned the wheel left instead of right and left me bewildered about what was going on. Still confused I didn’t notice that the wheel was still turned and we were heading into a ditch until it was too late. At that moment it felt like I was at the movies watching this through a big screen The car tumbled down out of the road for what felt like miles off of what looked like a cliff, eventually reaching the bottom of the ditch and flipping over. Nothing happened to me or my dad, and we crawled out of the book door of the car like nothing had just happened. I distinctly remember staring at the car thinking how I could have caused this much damage. The windshield of the car was completely shattered, as were two of the windows. The hood and was crushed and the roof was caved in almost beyond repair. That night I cried more than I had ever cried out of gratefulness to the lord. Yeah, I had destroyed my grandfather's car beyond repair, but we had survived in a situation where many others might not have. This was incredible considering the car was so old it didn’t even have an airbag and both me and my dad didn’t have our seatbelts on. The accident also showed me how many people truly cared about me. Immedietlyafter the incident, everyone who lived nearby, which was mostly just family, came running out of their houses to help me and my dad and to make sure that I was okay. These same people lied to the insurance company for us and told them that it was my grandfather who had been driving and not me so that there would be no legal trouble. 	I woke up the next day still upset with myself but feeling a lot better than I did the night before. Little did I know that things were going to get a lot worse. Around noon I was sitting around watching TV with my little brother when my dad got a call. His face scrunched up right away and it was incredibly visible that whatever the other person had said upset him. It was only after he got off the phone five minutes later we found out that my great-grandmother was dying. We instantly rushed out the door and ran down the street to my grandfather's brothers house, where my great-grandmother had been living. The first thing we saw when we arrived was the myriad of crying people, each one looking more devastated than the last. After that everything became numb. My great-grandmother had been incredibly valuable to me, every time I came to visit she would spoil me with sweet and jokes. She was one of the main reasons I looked for my annual visit to India so much. Unfortunately, we were unable to stay for the funeral since our flight was leaving the next morning. 	It was was one of the lowest points of my life, but summer 2018 taught about how much love I get from the people around me.  It also showed me how much I have to be grateful. This is a summer I will never forget.
