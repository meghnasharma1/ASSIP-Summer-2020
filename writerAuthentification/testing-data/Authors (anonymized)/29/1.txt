It was only when we analyzed the molecules I understood. I was wondering, “How could two substances, differing only by prefix have such a great difference in measurements?” The placement of one -OH group in a molecule can change its evaporation rate substantially. With the -OH group on the end of the molecule, it exerted greater intermolecular forces on the molecule and had lower evaporation rates as it bonded the molecule closer together. This subtle difference in molecular position can be the difference in saving thousands of dollars and recovering much more energy. We always hear about great oil reserves that have been untapped. The news is constant, climate change, running out of fossil fuels, energy conservation, etc. Scientists have known this for years and are formulating their own plans. They are researching efficient methods to recover unconventional oil products such as crude oil in areas like oil sands. There are three different forms of oil recovery in the process, primary, secondary, and tertiary. primary and secondary can recover any where from 20%-40% of the reservoir’s oil. tertiary, or enhanced oil recovery(EOR) can recover anywhere from 30%-60% of the reservoir’s oil. Recovering the most oil, it is not surprising that a prodigious amount of research has been devoted to improving tertiary oil recovery.According to Zhang, Xie, Cui, Chen, and Zeng (2019), one of the biggest challenges to sustain production of unconventional oil over time are the long term consequences of EOR. These consequences come from the wettability properties of the reservoir solids and can decrease  the efficiency of tertiary oil recovery over time. A popular way of maintaining reservoirs is to recover the water being used in the production. Zhang et al. (2019) mentioned that over the past 50 years, approximately 830 million cubic meters of mature fine tailings. Mature fine tailings (MFT) are made of water, solids such as coarse sands and fine clays, and bitumen (asphalt) residues. MFT are different because they occur in ponds with 70-80% water trapped within clay particles. The study measured forces in different petroleum systems, they used multiple techniques to do this. A couple of methods include surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy. Using the aforementioned methods the researchers reviewed results from using water and ions including Ca2+ and Mg2+. Researchers Saxena, Kumar, and Mandal(2019) attributed the reservoir rock wettability to the rock mineralogy, composition of the brind, as well as the temperature and pressure of the reservoir. Further examination led them to conclude the importance of intermolecular forces such as van der Waals (dispersion and dipole-dipole) forces and hydrogen bonding in the wettability of the reservoir rock. The different methods scientists have employed to increase the efficiency of EOR often include changing what they inject in the flooding process. Saxena et al. (2019) decided to use an anionic surfactant. The idea behind this was to reduce the tension between the crude oil and water, essentially changing the wettability of the reservoir work to more water based. Talking to a lead scientist who has written multiple articles on the topic of EOR, A. Mandal (personal communication, February 13th, 2019) made clear the importance of intermolecular forces in reservoir rock, crude oil, water, etc. Dr. Mandal sent me a powerpoint solidifying the importance of the wettability alteration of reservoir rock. The powerpoint included a diagram showing the alteration from oil-wet to water-wet. In this process the oil molecule was displaced from the reservoir rock and was replaced with a water molecule. This oil molecule is now available to be recovered. El-hoshoudy, Mohammedy, Ramzi, Desouky, and Attia (2019) looked into a subtype of enhanced oil recovery, chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR). In CEOR, chemical flooding is used in addition to water flooding to alter the wettability of the reservoir rock. The benefits of changing the reservoir rock wettability cannot be overstated, it displaces oil molecules to be gathered during recovery. The scientists used a hydrogel called Lutensol AT 25 E-Methacrylate surfmer. Their results were incredible, displaying their data through permeability curves, we could see clearly how the hydrogel altered the wettability of the rock to significantly water-wet (El-hoshoudy et al, 2019). Their estimations indicated a recovery factor of 85.35%, far greater than the generally accepted range of 30-60% (El-hoshoudy et al, 2019). Although this does assume certain conditions, it is certainly a step in the right direction. Another subtype of enhanced oil recovery is called chemical enhanced water alternating gas. This type of flooding was reviewed by researchers Kumar and Mandal (2017). They saw an approximate increase of 5% in recovery compared to water enhanced gas injection. The global importance of enhanced oil recovery can not be overstated. This can increase economic output of lower income countries by reducing the costs of recovering unconventional oil. I think the next step of this research process is field testing. Implementing these different techniques of EOR into actual oil sands and gathering data. The data being recovered now is small scale or relies on previously made field research. I think if we saw these new methods being researched in real world scale applications would bring the greatest advancement to the technology. The importance of EOR for growing and energy demanding world is increasing at a greater rate every day. Understanding and seeing intermolecular forces like I did in the evaporation rates of propyl and isopropyl alcohol can help us understand the interactions between the oil and water in these oil recovery processes.
