When my father lived in India, he would go the temple twice a week, on Tuesday and on Friday. On the days of going to the temple, one could not eat meat because it was considered sacrilegious to bring meat or alcohol into the temple. Now, in America, despite not going to the temple every Tuesday and Friday, my parents still tell me not to eat meat.	Religion and worshipping may have been the biggest change in America coming from India. In five minutes walking distance of my mother’s house are three temples, in our house now, the temple is forty-five minutes away. We’ll go to this temple once a month, but it’s just not the same.	When I was around six years old our family would to a religion study class for people of all ages. At the young age that I was I never grasped any of the concepts and in the language class couldn’t remember any of the difficult characters. My Sister on the other hand exceled, she was in her teenage years at the time and was not only smart enough to memorize the complex language and understand the deep concepts of the religion, but she also had friends to look forward to in the study. Our presence every Sunday grew more and more inconsistent, I often had sports tournaments and simply couldn’t make it. This didn’t help in my view of the religion and the way they were trying to teach it to me. Over time I became more resilient to going and after a few years of attendance we stopped going.  	My grandfather, however would have been more resilient in me being attentive in class and consistently showing presence. When he was in the military he was given servants for work, the job of these servants was simply to do whatever my grandfather told them to. This really changed his personality, working for years with servants under him he isn’t used to people not listening to him. A funny example was when he first to came America. He raised his children in a meat-eating household. When he came to America, he saw that my Father had become vegetarian and was always making my sister and I vegetarian as well. He wouldn’t tolerate this and immediately made him at least feed my sister and I meat. It was just the way his personality had become. 	My grandfather never took a great liking to America when he came here at first. It was a great bore to him as he didn’t any friends to walk with or any place to walk to. Living in India as a retired military officer for twenty years, he noticed quite the difference when he came to America. I can almost see a little bit of that in my identity. As a person who’s take on change is more reserved and unwilling. 	This really comes back to religion and how it affects me as a person. Whenever we go to the temple we go around the temple praying to each god and I would always ask my father who each god was and they did. It really only occurs to me now how deep his religious understanding was for him to answer each of my questions thoroughly. I’ve always strived for that sort of understanding of Hinduism, a religion so deep in culture with many interpretations, stories, and gods. It either must just be his forte, or a deep religious understanding that is hereditary among his family. I would never think of myself as an apostate but compared to people like my father and how deeply invested they are I almost feel like one.	My Uncle. He is quite a unique person in the sense that he doesn’t conform to the biggest indian cultural norm. Marriage. There were many times during my younger years when I would hear my father on the phone with his parents discussing some sort of plan to get my uncle married. My parents have always said that I’m sometimes a person of my own way and I have a good feeling it comes from my uncle. Why my uncle will never get married the world may never know but I know for sure that his persona and personal identity have played a part in my own. 	The main problem with me and religion is that I could never feel a connection. A connection to my roots. A connection to a religion that’s been in my family for generations upon generations. Moving to America has definitely changed my personal identity the most out of any other difference in my identity compared to my parents.
