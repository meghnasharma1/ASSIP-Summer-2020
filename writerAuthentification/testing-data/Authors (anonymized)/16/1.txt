Chances are, your phone or laptop has died on you sometime in the past. It leaves you helpless and dismayed, hoping whatever you were working on at least got saved. This happened to me one day at school: my phone ran out of battery in the middle of the day. Thankfully, I wasn’t working on anything important at the time, but it still annoyed me and left me wishing that batteries could last longer. Later that day, we were assigned the molecular chart lab in chemistry class, which entailed drawing and describing various molecules. I knew that these different shapes and structures all have different properties, and I realized that among these properties was conductivity. Thinking about how quickly my phone died earlier that day, I wondered if battery life, or more broadly, conductor efficiency, could be improved by changing the molecular structures of conductors.	A conductor is any material that allows the movement of electrons. The majority of conductors used in electronics are metals, namely copper and aluminum due to their low resistance and therefore high efficiency. When used in context of an electrical system, the energy lost to resistance is referred to as “voltage drop”(Mukherjee & Yadav, 2017). The voltage drop converts electricity into waste heat, which is why electronics will heat up during use. Conductors also have an upper limit to temperature at which they will melt (Mukherjee & Yadav, 2017). Therefore, if a conductor’s resistance is reduced, not only will the energy system will become more efficient, it will also be able to handle higher amounts of electricity. If a conductor’s resistance is reduced to zero, then it will allow electrons to pass through it freely(Conover, 2018). This is called a superconductor. The problem with superconductors is they require extremely low temperatures to operate, often near absolute zero(Conover, 2018). This makes them impractical for regular use.	In 2017,  Inoue, Suzuki, Matsui, Hirayama, & Kanno researched the structure of a new type of lithium ion conductor with the formula Li7Ge3PS12. This new substance was created through heating and gradual cooling of Li2S–GeS2–P2S5, a 3-part system. This particular structure possesses a special type of structure known as argyrodite, meaning it allows both anions and cations to be swapped out within the structure. The versatility of argyrodite structures provides many possible combinations of ions to create new conductors.  The results of this study showed that the new conductor was primarily made up of isolated tetrahedral GeS4 and PS4 structures. These individual structures then formed a framework in which lithium ions were found, creating a pathway for the conduction of electricity. This lithium ion conductor was found to be extraordinarily efficient and able to handle very high temperatures compared to commonly used conductors (Inoue et al., 2017). Therefore, argyrodite structures could be a possible tool through which other more efficient conductors can be created.	A similar study was conducted by Kitou et al in 2017. Kitou’s team studied the properties of the organic salt crystal (TMTTF)2PF6 as its temperature decreases and as it went through phase changes. The most interesting property of this feature was its peculiar behavior at around 47 degrees Kelvin. At that temperature, it undergoes a complete reversal in electrical behavior, changing from an insulator to a near-perfect conductor. This is standard behavior for a superconductor, except this crystal undergoes no visible structural changes, making the change in behavior seem impossible. This was called a structureless transition. However, this new study finally determined what structural changes occur within the molecule using a precise X-ray machine. They found that at 47 degrees, the crystal pattern changed on a 2D level, forming Wigner crystals. Wigner crystals are crystallized clouds of electrons that form when potential energy in a system is higher than kinetic energy (Kitou et al., 2017). The findings of this study imply that these Wigner crystals are what cause certain materials to become superconductors at low temperatures. As temperature decreases, so does kinetic energy. When kinetic energy gets low enough, these crystals are formed and the material becomes a superconductor. Therefore, if Wigner crystals were to be replicated under normal room temperatures, they could possibly be used to create superconductors more suitable for regular use. A separate study conducted by Mukherjee & Yadav in 2017 also yielded similar results. They tested four molecules, including the (TMTTF)2 molecule. Their findings indicated that specifically the d-level orbital electrons within each atom caused the 2D shape to form(Mukherjee & Yadav, 2017).	More recently, in 2018, Yu et al. conducted a study regarding the synthesis of the conductor Li6PS5x, with x being either Cl, Br, or I. This is an argyrodite structure. The traditional way to create these conductors was to mill the materials, meaning mixing them and spinning at high speeds and pressures. They tested a new method of synthesizing this molecule and other similar conductors by essentially heating them directly, automatically synthesizing the desired results. They found that this method created conductors that had consistently higher conductivities than their traditionally milled counterparts. [I haven’t received a reply to any of my scientist correspondence yet, but I plan to put it here] However, the two problems with this method are degradation of electrolytes and contact loss. For an unknown reason, the electrolytes within conductors created by this method will degrade and increase in resistance faster, and sometimes will even break contact with the chain and completely stop functioning (Yu et al., 2018). This study presents a new possibility of increasing conductor efficiency not by directly manipulating molecular structure, but rather by automatically synthesizing conductors in a more efficient way. If the two aforementioned shortcomings are resolved, this new method could potentially be a major step forward in conducting technology.Across the globe, billions of people use electronics every day. The amount of energy passing in and out of devices is enormous, and with this massive usage of energy also comes a massive waste of energy due to conductor inefficiencies. This means that even a small improvement in conductor technology could result in a significant amount of money and energy saved worldwide. 	 Imagine a world in which your phone almost never ran out of battery, a world where perfect conductors allowed seamless movement of energy. Perhaps the realization of such a dream may still be in the far future, but any improvement in conductor efficiency will bring about good changes. Everyone would benefit. Whether it’s big businesses or environmentalists, whether it’s the complex supercomputers at NASA or the tiny cell phones in our pockets, every group and every individual would eventually feel the benefits of better, more efficient conductors in their electronics.
