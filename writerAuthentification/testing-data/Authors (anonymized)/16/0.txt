“The calm before the storm”. It’s something you usually see in movies before a final fight scene. To me, it’s reality. In the morning I calmly wait, and all I can think of is blue.    Blue. Not a violently dark blue like the ocean, but rather a soft, light blue, like the color of the sky on a sunny Spring day. A blue that you can see right through; it’s calm and inviting. It doesn’t hold any secrets.Ironic, isn’t it, that such a serene, tranquil color could represent such a contrasting part of my life. The water that holds such a shade doesn’t represent serenity or tranquility for me. To me, it’s a struggle. A struggle to survive. A maelstrom of a struggle that leaves me gasping for air as I strain every muscle in my body, swimming into oblivion.     I started when I was six. The disparity between then and now isn’t quite as substantial as one may think. I don’t remember any single swim practice, but I do know that I screamed and cried every day, refusing to go to practice, only to be physically coerced into going by my parents. What’s the point, I would think. As it turns out, I’m still not so different. Every time my alarm goes off at four in the morning, I wonder why I do this to myself. I scream internally on the way to the pool, my struggle covered by the external illusion of peace.     Some time after I started swimming, I attended my first real swim meet. Today, I can’t recall a single practice I was forced to go to as a child. But my memories from this meet will stick with me forever. The water that day was a shining, pristine blue, sparkling like a thousand diamonds as the sunlight fell gently on its surface. This dazzling shade of blue greeted me in a much different manner than I was used to. It wasn’t as ironically calm and muted like usual. It seemed more like a friendly challenge, a dare to do my best. And I did. I poured every last ounce of energy I had into that first real race.    For my efforts, I received a blue first place ribbon. This time, the blue was a deep, dark blue, just like the ocean. A beautiful shade of achievement that hid the less pretty colors of struggle beneath its enchanting surface. For one brief, fleeting moment, I was thrilled. Then, a funny thing happened. On the car ride home, I was twirling this ribbon around my fingers when it slipped from between them and was sucked out the window. I immediately reached out to grab it, but I was too late. My happiness had quite literally slipped between my fingers.     To this day, I still look back at that day and laugh. I laugh because of how well it represents my feelings about swim. It’s a constant cycle of ups and downs. I work myself to a breaking point for a moment of joy, only to have it snatched away by the omnipresent dread of going to practice the next day.    Throughout the years, this cycle has repeated. I’m constantly fighting against my own being, against my own inherent laziness. I fight to keep myself afloat, both literally and metaphorically. It’s almost like what they teach us in health class. Just as drug addicts live through their pain for the promise of their next high, I fight through the pain of swim practice for the prospect of a new record, a new blue ribbon. Except, instead of an unhealthy substance that destroys my body, I get high off of my own achievements. I sleep happy knowing that the past however many excruciating workouts have paid off. And that’s where I found myself. It’s my identity now, a swimmer. I say it with pride, knowing that not just anyone can bring themselves to do what I do on a daily basis. Problem is, that’s only a small part of my life. The part where I get to show off the fruits of my labor pale in comparison to the labor itself, so what about that?    I’ve come to accept it now. I certainly still despise practices, and I’m always wondering why I’m doing this. But the voice somewhere in the back of my mind reminds me. It reminds me of the deep, comforting blue of victory. It reminds me of the thrill of racing. So during the calm before the storm, I focus on that. Because I now know that after a hurricane, there comes a rainbow. So as I jump into the deceivingly calm light blue water, I think of this. I think of blue.
