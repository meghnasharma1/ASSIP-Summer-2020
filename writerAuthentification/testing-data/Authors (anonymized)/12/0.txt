Work. My parents are where they are today not because of their parents, but because of their blood sweat and tears. To get to know me, you first need to know where my parents have come from. My mom and Dad were both born in India. Both from middle-class families. One that thought of going out for lunch as a rare luxury and owning a Mercedes as a dream that will never come true. At that age of 15, my dad immigrated to the US. The day before his 16th birthday, the legal age required to work, he went for an interview at a grocery store and asked if they would hire him. They said yes and the very next day on his birthday he went to work. He has never taken a break from then to now. He has worked his whole life and worked his way from the grocery stores to a seat at one of the top companies. 	Love at first sight. This all leads up to my parent's wedding. You would laugh at the way they got married if you compare it today. They saw each other for the first time 7 days before they got married and arrived at the marriage in a taxi. The whole wedding all together costed a total of one thousand dollars. That is most likely less than what we today spend on just the engagement ring. Then they moved to America and settled into a small house. After, a while after they were making some money they moved to a house in 2000. Then drastically our world changed. On September 11, 2001, our world changed forever. My dad was less than a mile away and was the runners when the building came crashing down. The way that we will be looked at forever changed. Even though we may not be Muslims, we were subjected to a lot of scrutiny and the world became suddenly a challenge. 	Me. My parents found out I was coming a few days before they scheduled to leave to go to Alaska. They were not expecting me at all and I came to them as a shocking surprise. I was born on October 6, 2003, and named Soham Gandhi, a few days after one of the most famous religious leaders was born, Mahatma Gandhi. I was always questioned if was a descendant of Mahatma Gandhi and sadly always so no. I wonder how life would differ had I been a descendant. From day one my parents never exposed me to technology and it would lot come for a very long time. When I was little I enjoyed playing and especially make noise. My parents love to recite stories of how I would convert pots and pans into drums and spoons and forks into drumsticks. If ever there was a utensil missing they knew exactly where to find it. However, my life drastically changed after my grandpa fell down the stairs. I was only 5 years old and I was going for a walk with him. We were walking back up the stairs to enter the home and suddenly, he fell. It is a memory ingrained into my brain. After that, he never was able to fully recover and in 2011 on his way to the place he always dreamed of seeing, Alaska, he passed away. My parents tried assuaging my feelings of sadness I had and tried to make me move on. 	Inventor. Once I entered middle school is when I shifted from a fun mischievous kid who was a Lego aficionado to a kid who was thinking of a career in engineering. I got my first programmable robot at this age called EV3. I learned a lot from it. The basic principles of coding and designing. In 7th grade, I got my first true programming kit a Raspberry Pi. This is where I learned a lot about syntax and the practical uses of coding and engineering. In 8th grade I helped my father out with his first patent - it was a way to use robots inside of datacenter, and to track and maintain the status of the all the servers. This jump-started not only my career in innovation, but also my father, and he to date he has 5 patents, and 3 patents pending. This is where I feel my engineering genes most likely have come from.	CubeSat. Today I am part of a group of kids here at TJ who are working to build a satellite that we are going to launch into orbit from the ISS. I work on the electronics components of the satellite and manage the power distribution throughout the whole CubeSat (the type of satellite that we are going to launch). My life has had up and downs, but it all has made me who I truly am today - a young kid who is also an inventor.
