               We gather around a small round table. Focusing in on a machine that looks like something from back to the future. Our chemistry teacher informs us that this is a Geiger-Muller-counter. We all stare in confusion. Where is the counter? Our teacher goes on to explain that this machine counts the number of disintegrations minute, the number of ionizing particles that hit the counter. Our teacher come goes back into a room and picks up a small piece of Cesium-137 a molecule that is highly radioactive. She plugs in the cesium into the machine and we quietly listen ticks coming out of the machine every time an ionized particle hits the Geiger-Muller-counter. Thousands of particles come crashing down into the Geiger-Muller-counter like a thunderstorm. 	From this lab, it struck me that radiation has real-life implementations. My parents were just talking about a neighbor at my old house who died from lung cancer. This helped me to make this correlation and straight away I went to researching about unique forms of radiation therapy (RT) that are in use, different ways of delivering the RT, and multiple ways of detecting the cancer cells or tumor without harming organs unnecessarily. I found out that cancer is quite a big problem and took almost 10 million lives in 2018 (Global Center Observatory, 2019).	The first article which I found researched the difference between two different forms of delivering radiation on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The two forms of radiation delivery the scientists researched were intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-DRT). IMRT is a form of radiotherapy which utilizes advanced software to spare adjacent structures near the malignant tumor from radiation damage. 3-DRT is a form of treatment that shapes the radiation beam around the edges of the tumor. This helps to reduce both the short-term and long-term toxicity of the treatment. The results from this study were that there is no significant difference in any measure of acute toxicity by the treatment technique. There was a small trend of lower rates of grade 2 or higher pneumatics among IMRT patients compared to 3-DRT. However, it was not significant to conclude anything from this research (Ling, Hess, Chen, & Daly, 2016) After I talk to Dr. Daly, I hope to be able to get future goals and further studies that may be conducted in order to get significant results.	The second article which I found researched different forms of imaging. The three primary forms of imaging technologies Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MRI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT). CT is currently today the standard that is used for lung cancer patients. This is because CT is more sensitive compared to radiography. CT can detect some changes four weeks in advance compared to radiography. MRI is another form of imaging that is less used for patients with lung cancer. This is due to the fact that MRI’s increased magnetic imaging susceptibility effects and respiratory motion artifacts. However, MRI scans are better at lung imaging with minimal artifacts from respiratory and cardiac motion. CT scans, on the other hand, have a better spatial resolution which is why it is not used for routine evaluation. This is because spatial resolution gives them the ability to detect the staging for cancer and detect early pneumatics or pulmonary metastatic disease. The main use of MRI is radiation therapy delivery planning. The last kind of imaging, PET-CT, is used for diagnosis, staging and examining the effects of the treatment. PET-CT is more accurate compared to CT alone in radiotherapy planning. PET-CT is also useful at identifying the metabolic response from radiation therapy. It assists in distinguishing between recurrent tumor and fibrotic changes, which are quite confusing otherwise. All the forms stated play a unique role with the stages of lung cancer and if used at the incorrect time could lead to unnecessary exposure to radiation or incorrect diagnosis (Benveniste et al., 2018)	 The third research article which I chose researched about proton radiation exposure. The main way for one to be affected by proton radiation is through deep space travel. Proton radiation is one of the major limiting factors for space travel and the major difference is that the form of radiation that is found in space has a lot more energy compared to the normal everyday radiation which we here on earth are exposed to. The effects found from this therapy where it led to more complex DNA damage compared to X-rays. They also found that takes three times longer for mouse treated with proton radiation to recover compared to those treated with X-rays. The researchers also found that proton radiation could also lead to more oxidative stress. The researchers moved on to see the effectiveness of proton therapy and found that it had a higher number of lesions and even larger lesions, but they did not have any advanced adenomas or carcinomas a hundred days after irradiation. The last major discovery by the researchers is that the exposure to proton led to a reduced life span for the mice compared to exposure to X-ray. The scientists concluded that proton therapy has quite a few biological effects which can lead to an increase in tumor progression (Luitel et al., 2018).	I hope to be able to further research the studies conducted and conduct my own experiment. In this experiment, I will use different animals and see if which form radiation is the most effective for killing cancer cells. The forms of radiation I will attempt to use will be gamma, alpha, beta, and positron radiation. These are different radiations which all have their pluses and minuses.
