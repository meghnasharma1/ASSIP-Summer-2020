Blue and green; the two colors I remember from my childhood. Blue like the summer sky, not a harsh blue, but a soft and relaxing blue. Like an ocean scattered with marshmallows of different shapes and sizes. Not just any green, but an inviting green. Green like the grass my siblings and I played in, filled with bugs and secrets. My dad would push us on the swings and we would compete to see who could go the highest while my mom and my grandparents would cook dinner for us.My grandparents never lived in America, but they visited most summers. I vaguely remember my grandma, but I still remember her cooking and her personality. As a young child, waking up to the smell of dumplings after a nap was the best feeling. The smell of pork, lettuce, all stuffed into dough was mouthwatering. Not only that, but she always put her family first. She sacrificed for my dad and his brother, and she sacrificed for me and siblings as well.That feeling was lost pretty quickly and when I was 7 years old we learned that my grandma had cancer. We quickly returned to China over the summer to see how she was. At the time, I was naïve and immature. I did not understand what was happening. We visited my grandma in the hospital and we were ecstatic to see her doing well. Our fears assuaged, we returned. I didn’t know that was the last time I would be able to see her again. My grandma lost the fight against cancer in 2009. I was 7 years old.A couple days later I remember waking up one morning in China to a grey and gloomy morning. I walked out my room and looked down the hallway. Dark, empty, and silent. Lonely and scared of what was at the end. When I finally reached the end, I turned right and saw dozens of people. Everyone on their knees, as if they were praying. I asked my dad what was happening, and he quickly motioned for me to go down on my knees. That was the first time I ever saw my dad and grandpa cry. When they finally stood up, I could tell they were both fraught with pain and suffering. Tears streaming down their faces, I started smiling. If only I understood what it was like for them. If only I wasn’t so young.Seeing my dad and grandpa break down was something I never thought I would see. That is when I realized how important my family was to my dad and grandpa. The next day we paid homage to our grandma. Me, my dad, my grandpa, and some relatives all squeezed into a van. For three hours, we sat in silence until finally we reached our destination in the mountains. Silence for my grandma. Silence to take in what had happened. In order to pay homage, we burned money as it was customary to do so in China. Smoke coming from the ashes of the money, a thick grey cloud rising up into the sky, we started to head back to the car. Silence once more. Over the next few years, the world went from blue and green, to dark grey. Dark grey like the clouds during a storm, cold and waiting to bring unhappiness. My grandpa would still come during the summer, just not as often anymore. When he did, it just was not the same as it was when grandma was here. My siblings and I still played on the swing, but soon we didn’t need anyone to push us anymore. At the end of sixth grade, we moved out of our home and into our new home in Virginia. I won’t forget the summers spent in the backyard playing on the swings and the hours spent lying in the grass, taking in everything. The blue, the green, and the bright yellow sun staring down at us.As I matured, I started to realize why my dad, a generally strong man, had broken down so easily when he heard the news of his mom’s death. Family started becoming more important than it used to be. I started to piece together why my grandpa had broken down, and I started to learn more about my family.My grandma was loved by everyone in our family, but my father, my uncle, and my grandpa loved her the most. Now, I finally understand why family is so important. Without a family, I would not be the person that I am today. After asking my dad how my grandma’s death affected him, I realized that I have to cherish what I have, and that I shouldn’t have any regrets about the decisions I make. Over the past 5 years, we visited China a couple times, and my grandpa sometimes comes during the summer. I love my grandpa, but sometimes I wish that my grandma was still here. I miss the bright mood that she brought. I miss the amazing food she cooked. I just wish I appreciated the moments I had with her instead of throwing them away.
