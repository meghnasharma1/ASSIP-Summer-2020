We were doing a lab in chemistry, when the Geiger counter we were watching made a beep. No one was expecting it, so we asked why it made a beep. Ms. Chhabra explained the Geiger counter made a beep because it detected radiation in the air. Later, we learned about the dangers of radiation exposure how bad it is for your health. Analyzing and detecting radiation is important, because then we know how to protect against it. Ray-tracing is just one of the many ways to analyze and detect radiation. 	The first x-ray was used in 1896. At the time, no one knew the harmful effects of radiation it gave off, and many scientists who used the x-ray ended up getting cancer and dying. As time went on, people research radiation and learned the dangers of getting too much exposure. The importance of detecting radiation and shielding against it became more and more important. Recently, there have been many studies involving ray-tracing, a new technology that can detect radiation very accurately and with very few resources. 	One of the uses of ray-tracing is for detecting electromagnetic radiation. Delgado and Cátedra (2018) used ray-tracing in their experiment in order to analyze electromagnetic radiation. In order to do their experiment, they created a mesh over a spot that they wanted to analyze (Delgado & Cátedra, 2018). Once they got the mesh, they were able to extract critical points from the mesh to be used for ray-tracing. These critical points generated a reduced mesh, which then went through full-wave analysis in order to achieve their results (Delgado & Cátedra, aa2018). They found ray-tracing provided very accurate results, with little resources needed (Delgado & Cátedra, 2018). Delgado and Cátedra (2018) noted the drastic differences in CPU usage between the conventional method for analyzing radiation and ray-tracing. All of the values for the conventional method were much higher than the ray-tracing method, while both of them showed similar data. 	Another use of ray-tracing is for modeling solar radiation pressure (SRP). Li, Ziebart, Bhattarai, Harrison, and Grey (2018) were able to model SRP’s effect on space vehicles like satellites. Li et al. (2018) found ray-tracing was the best approach to modeling SRP since the complex shape of satellites had to be considered when developing the model. In order to execute their experiment, they first had to create the complex shape of the satellite that was being modeled (Li et al., 2018). Once that was done, the scientists were able to set up a pixel array, with each pixel being the start of a ray (Li et al., 2018). The next step was to search all the geometric components and see if there were any intersections with the rays, if there was, they could calculate the radiation force for that area and sum it up (Li et al., 2018). In their experiment, Li et. al (2018) found the results to be very accurate. The first three reflections of the rays caught about 99% of the intersections and they recommended that the third reflection be considered because it brought the percent error to less than 0.035% (Li et al., 2018). Darugna, Steigenberger, Montenbruck, and Casotto (2018) also used ray-tracing to analyze SRP. Darugna et al. (2018) used ray-tracing to model the effect of SRP on QZS-1, a satellite. They found that the results with ray-tracing were not good, and performed worse than the box-wing model, which is the normal model (Darugna et al., 2018). However, Darugna et al. (2018) believed that the reason for these inaccuracies could be due to not having the thermal properties of the satellite. If a thermal radiation pressure analysis was provided, or the thermal properties of the satellite were published, the experiment would have different results. However, these are not the only uses for ray-tracing. 	In an experiment done by Kartashov and Shurshakov (2018), ray-tracing was used to analyze space radiation exposure at different shielding levels. For this experiment, the scientists used three different models: space environment models, spacecraft shielding models, and space radiation transport models (Kartashov & Shurshakov, 2018). In their experiment, they were able to verify the results of another experiment involving MATROSHKA-R, an experiment carried out on the International Space Station (ISS) (Kartashov & Shurshakov, 2018). For the first model, they found that the results were able to confirm the accuracy of their ray-tracing method (Kartashov & Shurshakov, 2018). In the second model, Kartashov and Shurshakov (2018) said that the results showed that the ray-tracing method can be applied in the design of the cabin so that enough shielding is used. The third experiment showed that the orientation of the body determines how much radiation that person will receive (Kartashov & Shurshakov, 2018). The scientists also mentioned that in order to get even more accurate results, a more detailed space station model should be used (Kartashov & Shurshakov, 2018). These results can be applied to analyze the dosage of crewmembers aboard a space station or to see if enough shielding is on the spacecraft. 	As we get closer and closer to manned missions to Mars, ray-tracing will become more and more important. The safety of astronauts is extremely important, and ray-tracing can help make sure that they won’t get lethal amounts of radiation exposure, while taking very few resources compared to other softwares. When I asked Dr. Li about her thoughts on the future of ray-tracing, she said “”. Another reason I believe ray-tracing will be useful in the future is because it can measure SRP. SRP affects the orbit of satellites, so adjusting the courses of satellites to not be affected by SRP is important. 	Ray-tracing has many different uses. One study used ray-tracing to detect electromagnetic radiation, while another used ray-tracing to space radiation. It’s important because it takes less resources to calculate radiation, while maintaining high accuracy. Using the information gained from ray-tracing, people will be able to figure out how to protect against radiation.
