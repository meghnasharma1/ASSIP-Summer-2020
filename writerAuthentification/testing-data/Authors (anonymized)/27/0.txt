“Balance! Find your balance,” she said, as I struggled to maintain my “aramandi.”Dancing is a dream that only a few achieve. It is a way to express yourself when no words are left. It is a form of expression rooted in the culture of your hometown. It has a distinct meaning for each individual.	My mom had always danced throughout her childhood, but lost her passion when there were varying priorities. Although many parents choose to live their dream through their children, she simply wanted to teach me the joy that comes with the art form. And so, I became a dancer. Not fully understanding the meaning behind it, I went through the motions. Stretching, practicing, and learning. Stretching, practicing, and learning. Performing, smiling through standing ovations. As a small child, I was oblivious to the true essence of dance, but enjoyed every moment regardless. That is, until the abrupt transition to public school.Public school, the daunting change most children fear. In second grade, I found myself surrounded by those who were immersed in a foreign culture. Slowly, I began to question my own lifestyle. I lost my love for my culture. I lost my love for my dance. Constantly worried of what others thought, I was shying away from the art that once gave me joy. The experience with new school teachers, who only seemed to have good words to say, was a stark contrast from my previous dance teachers who constantly carped at my wavering stamina. It felt as though dance was surrounded by despair. Reluctant to be a victim to their comments, I avoided the classes. And I fell victim to the cultural divide.I enrolled in ballet, hip-hop, and contemporary. I simply repeated the motions, hoping to find a love for something that wasn’t mine. Stretching, practicing, and learning. I had lost the fragile balance between my American identity and my Indian heritage. We went to the Montgomery Arts Center to watch yet another dance performance. My mom had told me that it would be better than the rest, the one to remember. I dragged my feet to the auditorium, afraid to approach the personification of my culture that I had lost. But I remember that performance, every detail.My teacher walked out onto the grand stage, against a shifting purple backdrop. Dressed as the beautiful Draupadi, she held her long braid confidently and began the piece. Every movement, every pose was done with otherworldly elegance and grace. Her countenance captivated my eyes, and I fell into the world of the Hindu epics. Transcendence, a simple way to describe the beauty before my eyes. From the shy movements of the timid wife, to the sinister smirk of the cunning gambler, she depicted a story through pure emotion. The torment in her eyes when Draupadi lost her dignity to her husband’s reckless gambling caused my vision to go blurry, with involuntary tears finding their way down my face. Through that performance, I found the meaning of dance. Dance can take you to a new world. It is about taking the audience on a journey, one that can only be expressed through intense emotions and deliberate motions. It is the unity of the performers, a sense of community. It is a connection to my heritage, by relaying the stories of our valiant gods. It is freedom, through the embodiment of different characters. It is complete abandon, letting your heart pour on the stage. Dance is distinct for every individual, and I found what dance meant to me.I began to dance with my heart, with everything in me. Dance suddenly found its way back into my heart again. It became my escape, the only way out of the constant chaos of competitive schools. Those surrounding me are often philistines, questioning the intricacies of the art form, as well as the foreign movements and costumes. Yet, I take no heed of inquiries. I learned to embrace the beauty of the heritage, community, and freedom that comes with Kuchipudi dance. My teacher established a school, whose raison d’être was to inspire young Americans to embrace the Indian heritage. Everyday, she battles with students who are forced into classes by parents who wish to instill their culture in their children. Not many have had the privilege of experiencing pure bliss through witnessing an incredible dancer move on stage. Lost in their American identity, they fail to view the Indian culture through the eyes of dance. Dance led me to embrace this culture that used to be my world. Unique choreographies with contemporary music and classical dancing have allowed me to express my two worlds through one story. As a little girl, I found dance as simply a connection to my culture. Now, it is my space in the vast divide between rigorous studying and free expression. Balance, a powerful space connecting my two worlds.
