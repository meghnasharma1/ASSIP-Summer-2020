Our teacher placed the radioactive sample beneath the tan box, and the class was startled by the loud beep immediately produced. The frequency of the beeps slowly quickened until our ears rang with the constant whine of the Geiger counter. We later learned the constant beeping we heard was the beta particles being emitted by the radioactive sample, Cesium-137. Excessive ionizing radiation, such as the radioactive sample decaying, can cause damage to the human body. Through our research, we realized that the effect of radiation can be measured through the values rad and rem. The fatal effects of radiation are apparent in many cells in cancer patients’ bodies, due to the high levels of ionizing radiation they experience to alleviate the tumor.In recent years, ionizing radiation therapy has become the leading solution for conditions such as cancer and tumors, because it is believed to be the most effective treatment for targeting damaged cells. Due to its effect on healthy cells, gamma radiation has been linked to the dysfunction of important structures in cells, which slowly leads to degeneration of individuals. There are various therapies, specifically stem cell solutions, that decrease the effects of ionizing radiation on human cells (Miller, Mardhekar, Rajasekaran, Zhang, & Kannappan, 2019). Researchers have conducted studies involving replacing affected blood-forming cells with cultured stem cells gathered before chemotherapy. Blood-forming stem cells are typically essential due to their ability to differentiate into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, each of which are essential to the function of the body.Assessing miRNA levels of cells that undergo radiation therapy has led to the conclusion the ionizing radiation used to target cells can cause cardiovascular diseases (Esplugas et al., 2019). Esplugas et al. (2019) chose to examine the acute response gamma radiation had on the miRNA levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The results clearly showed a drastic difference between the original expression of miRNA and the expression following high doses of ionizing radiation. Although there is no direct causation, the researchers believe that cardiovascular diseases can be caused by radiation. In addition to the creation of cardiovascular diseases, radiation is found to cause the degeneration of eyesight, a condition known as glaucoma (Hamada, Azizova, & Little, 2019). The negative effects of gamma radiation have been greatly assessed, and stem cell replacement is rising as a viable solution to counteract the degeneration of integral functions of the body.Stem cell replacement involves receiving a healthy blood-forming stem cell through a needle in your vein. An extracted cell differentiates into a human induced pluripotent cell, which is cultured throughout the period of radiation therapy and reinserted into the patient (Miller et al., 2019). Upon entrance into the bloodstream, the blood-forming stem cells travel to bone marrow, where they differentiate and replace the cells that were destroyed by radiation therapy. This is named an autologous transplant due to the fact the stem cells were gathered from the patient themselves. The blood-forming stem cells originate from the bone marrow, the bloodstream, or the umbilical cord.  Although studies have demonstrated the positive effects of stem cell replacement, researchers have only been recently using reliable cell trackers to fully understand the process of stem cell therapy. Yang et al. (2019) discuss the ionizing radiation induced effects on skin, and the possible solution of stem cell replacement. Using nanodots with aggregation-induced emission, they viewed the ability of the derived stem cells to treat the radiation induced damage. This is through the fluorescent capabilities of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) imaging that provides an opportunity to track the stem cell therapy. The AIE imaging allowed the researchers to see the determination, differentiation, and regenerative capabilities of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in treatment of radiation-induced damage.  J. Liu (personal communication, February __, 2019) mentioned “___.” The researchers concluded that they can track the stem cells with the AIE dot through noninvasive, precise, and quantitative techniques. Miller et al. (2019) chose to examine viable replacement stem cells to test the effects of the therapy on the various degenerative diseases. Stem cells undergo accelerated cell growth, leading to the loss of DNA integrity. The loss of DNA integrity occurs through the buildup of metabolites, specifically oxygen, carbonyl, and alkylating agents. Inserting the stem cells with a loss of DNA integrity can lead to various issues in the human body, such as mutations and DNA instability. To assess these effects, they tested the changes in cognition and various expression rates of specific markers in DNA. From this experiment, they found that if more than 10% of the DNA is damaged, the stem cell should be disqualified for replacement. However, recent alternatives, such as bioprinting of stem cells, offer a solution to the issue of loss of DNA integrity during accelerated cell growth (Ding et al., 2018).Radiation therapy is a widespread treatment to the fatal effects of tumors, and stem cell therapy has only been recently used as a solution to the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. However, stem cell replacement continues to be an unknown field, and as a result, many doctors don’t implement the practice with their patients. The therapy requires many clinical trials and various studies assessing the benefits of changing certain factors, such as bioprinting stem cells rather than culturing the cells. In addition, the smooth transition of the differentiation of the induced pluripotent cells has yet to be studied by researchers. With this information, the future will be able to adopt stem cell replacement to reduce degeneration, as an effect of ionizing radiation on the human body.
