Our chemistry teacher was at the front of the class, teaching us about how the Geiger-Muller Tube can measure the radiation emitted from a small disc of Cesium-137. As the particles emitted from the Cesium-137 bounced around the Geiger-Muller Tube, we heard odd pops and bangs from the instrument, measuring disintegrations over half a minute. Then our teacher decided to teach us about passive shielding. She wanted to show how different materials of different thicknesses could act as a blockade against these dangerous particles. We changed materials of shielding on top of the Cesium-137 disc and the thickness of these materials, and we measured the disintegrations occurring over thirty seconds for each type of shielding. BlanchfieF writes radiation is defined as an emission of energy as a wave or particle. People are exposed to radiation daily, though this is not necessarily dangerous. The damage radiation can cause to humans is dependent on three factors, the type of radiation, amount of time under radiation, and the location radiation is in contact with. When humans are exposed to dangerous radiation, it can lead to sickness, cancer, and birth defects in children (Blanchfield, 2018). On manned missions, astronauts are mainly exposed to solar particle events (SPEs) and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR). SPEs are generally an emission of a proton (positively charged particle in atoms) and GCR are comprised of electromagnetic radiation (Xu et al., 2018). Active shielding involves an electromagnetic field to bounce back radiation, though it is difficult to implement in a spacecraft. Passive shielding acts as a barrier to radiation, blocking the path of the high energy waves/particles. Considering humans are producing non-disposable waste at an alarming rate, reusing the waste on manned missions, as a form of passive shielding, could have many applications (Xu et al., 2018). The research conducted by Xu et al. (2018) indicates the possibility of the usage of trash shields as passive radiation shielding. Using high amounts of heat and pressure to remove water, the researchers compressed trash, consisting of mainly plastic packaging, personal hygiene by-products, foods, and towels/clothes, to form a shield. On a mission to Mars, every kilogram added to the spacecraft will add $200,000 in costs to the mission. Considering, the trash used in the study was approximately 30% water by mass, removing the water from trash can help create lighter shielding materials than normal trash. Their research suggests in future missions, onboard processing of trash into shielding, may help reduce load and recover clean drinking water. Furthermore, the water from the trash would help decrease required stored water, decreasing the mass of the spacecraft. Their research suggests a strong correlation between thickness of the shielding used and the amount of energy emerging through the shielding. Moreover, their trash shield seemed to be more effective than aluminum and water shielding at lower incident proton energies. Although, at higher incident proton energies, there was minimal difference between the shielding types. It is important to note the 10 g/cm² water and trash shields performed very similar under all incident proton energies. At the four tested incident proton energies, the trash shield let the least number of high energy particles through it, compared to the to the other shields. It is important to note, all the data was derived using a Monte Carlo algorithm, an algorithm using previous data to predict future circumstances (Xu et al., 2018).  Currently, the International Space Station utilizes polyethylene (plastic) (CH²) blocks in sleeping quarters to shield astronauts from radiation (Guetersloh et al., 2006). Polyethylene is made from carbon and hydrogen, and due to the low atomic number for these atoms, it should be more effective as a shield. Using a Monte Carlo algorithm, the researchers predicted the effectiveness of polyethylene as a radiation shield. Considering the abundance of plastic, polyethylene shields would be very easy to craft from trash.	Some people may express concerns, regarding the stability of plastics and other trash as radiation shielding. Contrary to what many people think, though polymers form covalent bonds or ionic bonds (cross-linking) under gamma radiation, plastics can will not significantly degrade under this radiation (Porto, Napolitano, & Borrely, 2018). The researchers tested plastic and paper packaging under 25, 40, and 50 kilograys (kGy). Considering, a significant portion of trash produced by astronauts consist of personal hygiene by-products and packaging, it would be important to determine whether or not these materials can withstand radiation (Xu et al., 2018). Porto, Napolitano, & Borrely (2018) found an insignificant amount of difference in the tensile strength and tearing resistance for plastic packaging before and after radiation. On the other hand, paper was less durable under radiation, as it had a more significant amount of degradation in tensile strength / tearing resistance after radiation (Porto, Napolitano, & Borrely, 2018). Though it is important to note both the paper and plastic packaging were thin sheets, though as a shield it would be compressed with other pieces of trash to form a shield. Additionally, a review conducted by Wang et al. (2018), suggests carbon nanostructures and nanocomposites could be effective in electromagnetic shielding. If advancements are made in the carbon nanostructure/nanocomposite creation process, taking into account the abundance of carbon in plastics and trash, carbon nanostructures/nanocomposites would be ideal as passive shielding against radiation.	Most studies conducted in this field use data simulation algorithms, such as Monte Carlo simulations to obtain data on waste as a shield against radiation. As it would be difficult and expensive to test the effect of radiation on humans in space with trash passive shielding, testing on Earth with existing radiation shields is important. Malkapur & Narasimhan (2019) have tested the addition of waste polymers into existing concrete shielding to diminish effects of nuclear power plants on health. The research looked specifically into the effect of neutron radiation from nuclear plants. They tested the addition of waste polymers into the vanilla concrete shielding and recorded the results in the study. Their research showed a strong correlation, demonstrating the waste polymer concrete effectiveness compared to normal concrete shielding (Malkapur & Narasimhan, 2019).	It is very important for NASA and private space organizations to sufficiently shield manned missions from radiation for the safety of the astronauts. The possibility of reutilization of non-biodegradable waste as radiation shielding can be viable, as highlighted by many research papers. Contrary to public belief, radiation will not stop NASA from exploring space. NASA is already taking significant steps to advance research in passive and active radiation shielding (Edwards, 2017). Future space exploration missions will take humans to Mars and beyond, though discovering novel radiation shielding methods is crucial.
