My parents immigrated to America, The Melting Pot, The Land of Opportunities, ‘Murica, many years ago. My dad, specifically, emigrated from a small farming family in rural India. They never had it easy, and this is evident to me, no matter how much my parents avoid the topic. However, my life has been easy, living with largesse and comfortably in suburban communities with everything I need. As I grew up and garnered new information, my views on this different world my dad came from changed drastically. 	Having their entire family back in India, my family would visit India almost every summer when school was out for me. As a child, I enjoyed riding on the plane, due to the unlimited amounts of movies I could watch. I would watch everything on the plane until we landed, binge watching for over a dozen hours in a row. To my parents, the plane ride was a necessity to reach their destination, a necessity that was unnaturally uncomfortable. Although, to my parents, every visit meant that they got to see their parents, siblings, family, and the friends they left when moving to America. To me, visiting my dad’s old home was an adventure, like a campout. I got to see a different world there. A world I would never have seen near my house. A world without television airing my favorite cartoons and shows on Cartoon Network at 8 AM on the weekends. An isolated world filled with forests and a small community with less than five families in a very large area. A world where I could explore very big old homes built with concrete and stone, find a new passage or room everyday leading to somewhere else, and easily find myself lost. A world where I, with my dad’s help, could explore the dangerous acres of forests, farms, and land where my dad grew up near. Every trip, I would bring my toys and electronic tablets to play with my cousins in India. We would play Angry Birds, Uno, and Minecraft together. To me the adventure was playing in a house without A/C in hot, humid weather. To my cousins it was the adventure of playing on my electronic tablet and with my toys that they normally could not access. These vacations were always a source of fun and enjoyment for me. 	As I grew older and learned more about the world around me, however, I started to see a different world whenever we visited. The world without television was due to a lack of a stable connection to the electrical grid. There was never a stable WiFi connection to play games. The world with forests and small communities became undeveloped areas of the world. The big old homes built with concrete and stone were worn down and falling apart. I realized that my dad had to walk many miles to reach his school through the dangerous forest, which I once was guided through. My dad had to inherit everything from his older siblings. His desk, his supplies, his room, everything was from his older siblings. All these realizations overwrote my past appreciation for the world I observed, and I began to dislike the frequent visits to India. Similar to a crisis of faith, the adventures I had once idolized became distasteful, and I no longer strived for the adventures as I once would have. I had a simple question: what does this different world actually mean to me.	When we visited India last year, I mercurially found the answer to what this different world truly meant to someone like me. I realized during my last few visits to India, that the meaning of this different world was just simply an opportunity to talk and catch up with family living across the world. During these moment, I came to the understanding of the importance of this different world. When my grandmother passed away and everyone from my dad’s family came together for the funeral, I began to recollect what my dad had told me many years’ prior, “to me family will always be the most important thing.” I realized that to him this different world wasn’t about the adventures nor the stark realization of the negative aspects of growing up there. This different world had a completely different connotation. To everyone living their it was the community, and to my dad it was the family left behind. I began to view the world as I do now. The ability to fly to India annually or biennially meant to my dad that he could always visit this different world. A world we visit so often for the aspects of family and community it has.
