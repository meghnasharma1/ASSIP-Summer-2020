I glanced at the clock. It was one o’clock in the morning and I began to write up my lab report for the caesium disintegration lab. I tried to recall everything that happened during the lab. The ticks that came of the Geiger counter that counted the number of disintegrations per minute. We used Caesium-137, a highly reactive metal, to model beta decay. Our teacher had warned us about the dangers of radiation during the lab. However, we were safe during the lab because caesium-137 gave off very little radiation. Before I could go to sleep, I still had one section to write: conclusions. I glanced at the rubric. “What other investigations might help you make a stronger conclusion?” I knew that radiation is commonly used in cancer treatments, and during X-rays, patients wear heavy lead aprons to block the radiation. That made me wonder, how radiation can both harm and help a patient?According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, caused by uncontrollable cell growth in the mammary glands. (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). In 2017, there were an estimated 255,180 new cases of breast cancer and around 41,070 deaths (American Cancer Society, 2017). There are four possible treatments: surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation therapy. Radiotherapy, a treatment that creates DNA damage and induces cell death, using high-energy rays, is a method that is extensively used to treat breast cancer. Although radiotherapy is an effective form of treatment, many cancer patients shy away due to the adverse side effects. In fact, many studies and clinical trials have found that radiotherapy used to treat breast cancer leads to an increased risk of secondary cancers. In 2017, scientists in Utah conducted a study to assess the risks of secondary cancers in patients who had been previously treated for breast cancer using radiation. The results were then compared to patients who did not receive radiotherapy for breast cancer. The patients in this study were treated with two types of radiation therapy: external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or brachytherapy (Burt, Ying, Poppe, Suneja, & Gaffney, 2017).  EBRT, also known as proton beam radiation therapy, uses proton beams to kill the cancer cells with a machine called a cyclotron. Proton beam therapy uses protons to deliver radiation to kill the tumor while minimizing the damage to healthy tissue. The patients involved in the study were all identified through the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program. All the patients in the system were initially diagnosed with breast cancer between 1973-2008 and no patients had a secondary recurrence within a year. In total, there were 374,993 patients who met the criteria from the database. Of those 374,993 patients, 154,697 patients were treated with radiotherapy. After conducting a statistical test, the results found that 49,867 of all patients developed a secondary malignancy. Out of those patients, 18,675 who received radiation developed a secondary malignancy (Burt et al., 2018). The scientists also found that the occurrence of secondary malignancies such as melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia statistically significantly increased in breast cancer patients who had undergone radiotherapy (Burt et al., 2018). Based on the results of this study, there is a great risk that breast cancer survivors face concerning secondary malignancies. The risk of secondary malignancies were higher in patients who were exposed to radiotherapy at a younger age and also had a longer time between the diagnosis of breast cancer and the diagnosis of the secondary malignancy (Burt et al., 2018).As previously mentioned, proton radiation is a way to treat cancer. A study conducted in Texas found that in mice, proton-induced radiation can lead to the proliferation of cancer cells (Luitel et al., 2018). The researchers examined survival and the development of lung cancer in mice that were exposed to acute proton radiation with a dose of 20 cGy/min. Once irradiated, the mice’s DNA was tested for damage. The studies found that the exposure to the radiation caused DNA damage in the lung that took long to repair. It was also found that the exposure to proton radiation reduces lifespan and increases the aggressiveness of the cancer (Luitel et al., 2018).Although studies, such as the one conducted by Burt and colleagues, can show that patients who had received radiotherapy are at a risk for developing secondary malignancies, it does not account for several confounding variables such as their diets and how healthy the patient is post radiotherapy. A study conducted in China found that radiation induced the spread of triple negative breast cancer cells (Lin, Bai, He, Wu & Wang, 2018). Triple negative breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that lacks estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptors. Due to the lack of receptors, triple negative breast cancer is not treatable by other types of cancer treatment such as hormone therapy. This experiment shows that radiotherapy can trigger the signal transduction pathway that increases the invasion of healthy cells (Lin et al., 2018). To conduct this study, the scientists used human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and cultured them in a medium. Then, the cells were irradiated with a dosage of 2.789 Gy/min. Once irradiated, the cells were wounded and then cultured in a medium that prevented the growth of the TNBC cells. Then, the cells were irradiated once again. A cell migration software was used to analyze the relative migration distance. To test cell proliferation, cells were treated with radiation and without radiation. After this, the cells were incubated in a media that contained a CCK-8 solution, which is essentially a dye that determines cell viability in the proliferation of cells. The cells were cultured for two more hours and then tested for absorbance. The results found that radiation can cause the malignant TNBC cells which may lead to a secondary malignancy.  (Lin et al., 2018). I emailed the scientist of this paper, but have not yet gotten a response. Cancer affects people all around the world. Reducing the adverse effects that radiation has after therapy can decrease the rates of returning cancers. Radiation is one of the leading treatments of various types of cancer, however, the various side effects and the fact that it is not completely effective causes people to shy away from radiotherapy. Patients who need multiple doses of radiation are at risk of a secondary malignancy. The next steps in this research process would be to find ways to use radiation to target only the cancer cells without damaging healthy tissue. However, this is a tricky solution because the radiation must be accessible all around the world, and not only in developed countries. Finding solutions that will decrease the risk of cancer after radiotherapy will benefit cancer patients globally, and prevent many future cases or relapse, or secondary malignancies.
