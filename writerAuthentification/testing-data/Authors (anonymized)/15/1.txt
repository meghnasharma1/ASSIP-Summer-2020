Mallika KhatiCHUM English 10 Period 2November 28, 20181271 words My Home Away from Home	Colorful balloons. Laughter, dancing, singing. A multitude of pink and white streamers line the walls as my mother gives an effusive welcome to the family and friends who arrive to my birthday party. The tables are filled with momos, sel roti, and a large variety of other foods from my parents’ home country. I am a year old and my first exposure to Nepalese culture is right in my mother’s native city of Kathmandu.	I am five years old and my father carries me down a long winding roads filled with sharp turns and gravelly soil roads. My mother trails close behind with my younger sister on her back with my cousins, aunts and uncles following behind. A dark curtain fell over the sky as the stars began to shine their way through. On our way to my father’s ancestral home in a small village six hours outside of Kathmandu, the capital city. If the bus had not broken down halfway through our journey, we would have reached hours ago, however there was no other transportation in the rural parts of Nepal. 	“Are we there yet?” I whine, latching onto my father. My cousin, pops up behind me and whispers in my ear that if I wait a little longer, we can watch Dora when we get to my father’s village. I remember stopping for noodles at a small corner store. My eyes felt heavy and my vision blurred as I slurped on something familiar-- Maggi noodles that my mother would make in the US, during the harsh winters of Massachusetts. “Dhanyavad” is all I can say before we proceed back on our route. Thank you. Before I know it, I wake up in a bed. It was my father’s room when he was a child. The bed is nothing like mine. It’s a simple bed for a simple man. But mine has princesses on it at home. I walk outside with my mother to accompany my relatives during breakfast. Except, to go to the kitchen, we had to walk down a large flight of stairs to go out to another building. I immediately hate it here. My cousin lied, there was no TV-- there was not even a lamp in the room! An unlit kerosene lantern sat in the corner of the room. I want to go back to Kathmandu. I ran my hand across the wall as I waddled my way down the stairs. The handmade house’s white powder rubbed off on my hands. This place bewildered me. It was so gross here, how could my grandparents have lived here? As I stepped outside, the breathtaking view captured my eyes. The hills of land were cut into terraces in a shade of green I had never laid eyes on before. The vast acres of untouched land, where generations before me cultivated their foods, was lined with oxen. As I made my way to accompany my relatives with my mother, we sat down to eat breakfast. I sat on my father’s lap as he began introducing me to his family. “This is one of your hajuramas, my aunt,” he pointed as an old lady with a gold septum ring dangling from her nose.“She looks like a bull,” I said. I immediately got a light smack on the back of my head from my mother. “You’re lucky she does not understand English or she would have been very angry,” my mother reprimanded me. I shrugged, it was not like I was going to see her ever again.Three months in Nepal felt like a dream. My second first hand experience of Nepalese culture. I came back to the US and bragged to my friends in preschool about being on a plane. My teacher let me skip nap time and tell her about my visit. I am proud to .I am eight years old when I get my first gunyo-choli. My aunts came to visit us in Massachusetts from Nepal. The traditional dress is accessorized with heavy gold necklace that is thick enough to be strung around my shoulders, and a gold headpiece. They gave me a cotton blouse, called a gunyo-choli, a red fariya, and a bright yellow patuka. As I put on each piece I feel closer to my culture. I can barely speak the language, and neither can I read or write in it. After my mother ties the floral skirt, fariya, around me and secures it with the yellow patuka, she takes pictures as I twirl around in my new clothes. I fumble with my words, but I can make out “Malai dherai man parcha”. I like it a lot. However, after the impromptu photo-shoott, it goes into a closet and never sees the light of day ever again. From that day on, I make a cognizant effort to learn more about my culture. I am ten years old when I realize being different is not always a good thing. I sit behind the counter at my parents convenience store. The cool night breeze that flows through the doors alleviates some of the sweltering heat of the mid-august dog days. My mother turns off the lights and it is time to close for the day. All of a sudden, a man walks in. He stays for twenty minutes walking around in the dark. My parents let him shop around because the nearest grocery store is a 20 minute drive. When he finally arrives at the counter, he plops down around twenty five dollars worth of grocery on the counter. My father asks the man whether he would be paying in cash or check because we had closed down the credit card machine. The man refuses to pay in cash and demands my parents that they put it on tab. My parents politely decline, reminding the gentleman that they cannot give people things on credit. The man immediately starts hurling abusive language at my parents. “Go back to your country,” and things along the lines of “stupid immigrants”. My parents are rightful citizens of this country. My body recoiled at every insult thrown. They quickly ordered the man to leave. I stay wide eyed and silent the entire time. Being seen as American carried more respect than being seen as a foreigner. I wanted nothing to do with my former culture. As the years went on, I felt the disparity between me and Nepal increase. But in April of 2015, I saw my mother frantically flipping through news channels while holding her phone between her shoulders and her ears. Tears brimmed her eyes, begging to escape. I caught a glimpse of the news. Earthquake in Nepal. Death toll of nine thousand. My cousins never picked up the phone. My stomach turned as I watched the horrors of the fallen buildings and dying people.“Do you remember the old aunty with the nose ring?” My mother asked me, “Your father’s village was destroyed by the earthquake. She is staying in Kathmandu with a few other relatives.”. I had to do something. The earthquake struck its wrath on Nepal, but this was ground shaking to me. This was my family. I could not ignore this any longer. This is what made me who I am. My family and I started a food drive, we donated blankets and food to send to Nepal.  That day, I could have lost everything I loved. From the memories from those generations before me all the way to the language that still does not quite roll off my tongue. Yet, it was a chance for me to make sure I never forget who I am.
