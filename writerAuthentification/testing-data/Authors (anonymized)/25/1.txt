I fell in love with the Molymod kit at first sight. Its large assortment of brightly colored balls (“atoms”) and plastic white sticks (“bonds”) allowed for endless possibilities of mix-and-match. There is nothing more satisfying than the click of a white stick fitting snugly into the side of a ball. The creative aspect of Molymod made it difficult for me to comprehend the fact that any ball-and-stick model that I could create translated to a unique chemical compound on the molecular level of matter. The versatility of atoms and elements to produce seemingly infinite results with a finite toolkit fascinated me. I began to speculate of a miracle substance which was able to change its structure and properties with the addition of mere minutiae. Such a substance that could become something different would benefit not only science, but also humanity . These thoughts led me down the path to graphene. Graphene may just be a nanosheet of sp2 bonded carbon atoms, isolated from graphene as recently as 2004 (Malik, Tomer, & Chaudhary, 2019) , yet it can be transformed and applied in a multitude of situations. The specific bonding and arrangement of the carbon atoms gives graphene an extraordinary range of properties, from high electric conductivity to a strength two times that of steel. Malik, Tomer and Chaudhary (2019) advocate for the use of graphene in sensing applications not only because of its versatile properties, but also through regulation and modification of graphene’s properties and surface chemistry, such as adding layers or doping graphene with other elements. Humidity sensing is a popular application of graphene’s properties. Unmodified graphene is already sensitive to humidity due to its high surface area to volume ratio and defects that increase molecular absorption (Xing et. al, 2019). Researchers at Penn State emphasized the usefulness of doping to stabilize graphene’s defects and introduce new chemical properties. These defects, which are holes unoccupied by any atoms, occur in its structure and can be stabilized by doping, or adding new atoms to replace the defects (Eurekalert, 2016). Rathi and Pal (2017) demonstrated the positive effects of using doped graphene in humidity sensing. Graphene oxide, a chemical derivative of graphene, was doped with lithium and boron and compared against undoped graphene oxide to test response time to humidity conditions. Both doped graphene oxides resulted in faster response times than undoped graphene oxide, particularly lithium. Lithium contributes additional functional groups to graphene that are hydrophilic, meaning they help graphene absorb water molecules quicker and decrease response time as a result (Rathi & Pal, 2017). The same properties that make graphene successful in humidity sensing, such as high mechanical strength and flexibility, also enable its usefulness in measuring temperature. Instead of doping graphene, Davaji et. al (2017) synthesized single-layer graphene on two different silicon membranes (SiN and SiO2) to analyze the sensitivity and response of these composite graphene sensors. However, sensitivity and response time are indirectly measured through measuring electric resistance at different temperatures. When the temperature increases, atoms in graphene and its defects vibrate, which increases the resistance (C. H. Lee, personal communication, February 6, 2019). Davaji et. al (2017) found that single-layer graphene synthesized on the SiN membrane allowed for the highest sensitivity to resistance changes and consequently temperature changes. The SiN also showed the fastest response time due its own low thermal mass coupled with graphene’s low thermal mass, meaning that heat took less time to pass through and ultimately sped up the response time. 	Graphene’s potential stretches far beyond abiotic environments, however. Tiwari, Vij, Kemp and Kim (2016) identified several carbon-based nanomaterials capable of detecting biomolecules such as DNA, proteins and RNA. Graphene’s high surface area and electric conductivity increases its sensitivity as a biosensor. Giust et. al (2018) used a similar idea to inspire their research of detecting zinc deficiency in crops. They targeted mRNA (the blueprint of all proteins in a cell) associated with proteins in the cell membrane that were upregulated in response to zinc deficiency. The plant’s mRNA was then mixed with fluorescent upconversion nanoparticle (UCNPs) and graphene oxide, which contained target sequences that matched with plant mRNA. If the target sequences on the mRNA and UCNPs matched up, then the mRNA would bind to the UCNP and stay fluorescent, as it would not be absorbed into the graphene oxide. Graphene oxide, well known for its ability to quench fluorescence, was used as a visual marker to show whether a sample of mRNA collected was related to zinc deficiency. Most importantly, Giust et. al (2018) designed their sensors to be portable, which is most practical for agricultural work and crop harvests. 	The doping of graphene with lithium to enhance sensitivity to humidity, as well as the formation of a composite graphene material with the silicon membrane, demonstrate the most useful aspects of graphene. It may stand alone, but simple additions to it transforms into a highly effective and accurate sensor targeting a selected variable. The variety of applications underscores graphene’s significance and ability to revolutionize current technologies and improve living conditions. With the advance of technology in all fields, such as medicine and biotechnology, the need for faster and more accurate sensors is growing (Davaji et al., 2017). Not to mention, using graphene in biomarkers could mitigate or drastically diminish crop deficiencies around the world. Poor crop harvests are a major factor behind a lack of food security, especially for those of lower socioeconomic status (Guist et al., 2018). Graphene’s potential to revolutionize the global agricultural sector in plant monitoring speaks volumes to its name. 	Before graphene, scientists were forced to spend time and money on their experiments, only to return a solution that was not cost-effective or accurate. Graphene kills those two birds with one stone. No material has come before graphene with as many built-in properties and room to add on even more. This idea bears similarity to the branched creativity of the Molymod kit. With all its pieces, the possibilities just keep stacking up.
