In fall of 2016, my paternal grandmother passed away. I wasn’t there for the death, and by the time I had arrived home, she had already been taken away. We were unsure of her age, because she had been born in a time when the solar calendar wasn’t in use, but we knew she was around 90 years old. My grandfather, who broke down at the funeral after seeing her body, was a few years older. I didn’t think much of it, considering I had never been very close with my grandmother. She had suffered a stroke and a bad fall, causing her to be physically disabled through her elderly years. She spoke rarely, sometimes elapsing into silences that spanned days, no matter how many times we addressed her. Luckily for me, two years later, her death came back to haunt me when I travelled back to China, my family’s homeland. When we returned to my parent’s hometown in the Hunan province, we first visited my grandmother’s younger sister, the only one out of my grandmother’s immediate family remaining. Her apartment, located within the crowded roads of Hunan University, was a small, yet well-kept, warm and welcoming adobe that demonstrated an impressive level of caretaking, especially for a woman in her nineties. She herself embodied the spirit of her apartment, greeting my family with a smile and offering me a slice of watermelon, my salvation during the characteristically thick, sweltering humidity of China’s summer evenings.	Throughout the visit, I mostly sat to the side, eating watermelon and listening in occasionally as the adults caught up with each other. I watched the happy reunions of aunts, uncles, cousins, in-laws and any other familial relationships I could think of. Without really anyone else to talk to or anything to do, I listened to the conversations passively, tuning out most of the moments and memories floating around the air. The only thing I realized from my subconscious picking up bits of speech here and there was that these people had really lived and gone through a lot. I saw this a lot in my grandaunt,  who was perhaps the oldest out of everyone there. She usually kept a smile on her face; however, when the subject of her sister’s death surfaced briefly before it was hurriedly dismissed, the light in her eyes dimmed a little even though her smile still remained on her face. I thought back to what my father had said about how her relatively large family, with five other sisters, had all disappeared except for her. My heart pained a little for her and I wondered how she felt when she first received the grim news.I wandered out of the apartment building, still in a half-sunken state where the sounds of farewell chatter faded into white noise all around. I stood at the edge of the stairwell, echoing the same goodbyes robotically to all the relatives who had cared for me at such a young age but I had no memory of. When almost everyone had left and I was left staring at their backs as they walked back out into the blinding heat, a conversation out the corner of my eye piqued my interest.My mother, the last one to leave, had been on her way out the door when my grandaunt seemed to stop her. The words whispered between them were soft and in my heat-stricken state I did not hear most, but one sentence managed to reach through the fog surrounding my brain. These pivotal words, which would eventually end up changing my entire way of thinking and acting, were simply “I’m scared because my heart hurts so much.”At this point, my brain finally registered that the conversation was personal and maybe I shouldn’t be intruding. I turned back and slowly made my way down the stairs, the creak of each step echoing in the hollow stairwell ringing in my ears as I attempted to process what just happened. Considering her somber tone, which was in stark contrast with the lighthearted tone she had adopted earlier, I quickly deduced she was talking about my grandmother’s death, and possibly the fear of her own death later. But that was my only starting point, because I couldn’t figure out the meaning behind her cryptically phrased words. My mother, who came down only a few minutes later and acted like nothing happened, dismissed my inquiries, citing it as “just personal things”. Unfortunately, burning questions age like fine wine. The phrase played on a loop in my head and imbued itself into my thoughts that night, during the week, on the plane back home and throughout the rest of summer. In English, the term “heavy hearts” is used frequently  to refer to the aftermath of a tragedy or disaster. My grandmother’s sister was obviously still reeling from the sorrow she had experienced over her last immediate relative’s death, but the hard part was figuring out why she scared of her own grief. Wasn’t grief necessary in the process to heal all wounds, and therefore should not be shunned, but accepted? Hadn’t a woman who had lost so much learned how to deal with grief already? It took many nights slipping in and out the philosophical folds of the universe before I began to formulate a hypothesis. I don’t call it a theory because there is no evidence to support it, except for my own personal experience with the death of a relative and the effect it had on one other person. From the limited knowledge I had, I figured that if a heart could get heavy with the impact of a traumatic event, then couldn’t it also get heavier from accumulating emotional baggage over a longer period of time? From there, the heart gets so heavy that the rest of the body responds. The limbs weaken, the heartbeat slows down, the eyes fail, and the neurons in the brain move slower in making connections as the body starts a slow decline into eternal rest. It is inevitable for everyone, though it comes easier for those who have accepted their fate and drift off into their slumber peacefully without struggle. I know from eavesdropping on my parents’ conversation that evening, that my grandmother’s behavior prior to her death suggested that she went peacefully, but I still wonder if her mind fought fate until her last breath. One day, the last person who has kept some remnant of her preserved in his memory will also pass. It’s the same as asking the question, “If a tree falls in the forest, but no one is around to hear it, does the tree make a sound?”, rephrased as “If a person dies, but no one is around to hold their memory, has the person ever existed in the first place?”. To me, the thought of being wiped off the face of humanity in the long run is scarily monumental to consider. What I learned by listening to my grandmother’s sister was that her heart was also fraught with these same thoughts. She had obviously pondered over the meaning and path towards death while her family faded away, one by one. Her face radiates serenity and closure but I wonder how heavy her heart is.  I also thought of the rest of my extended family in China, whom I had regarded with blank faces and half-hearted smiles. To me, they were complete strangers, and to them, I was one of the people who wouldn’t have any story of them after they disappeared. They had countless memories with me, yet I had so little with them to hold onto. In retrospect, I would give anything to go back and grow closer to them so I could carry their torch a little longer on this planet. I don’t even know if this is what my grandaunt thought, but regardless of whether it’s how all people feel, my hypothesis has become a form of liberation and enlightenment. They say time is of the essence, but that statement is only true when the infinitely many moments within time are wasted. They also say that treat others the way you wish to be treated, but no one ever thinks about the long term implications of that statement. The way someone walks on the planet is the same way they walk in the afterlife. It would be nice to not be remembered as a hateful spirit, but rather as someone who cherished her connections and interactions with other people.
