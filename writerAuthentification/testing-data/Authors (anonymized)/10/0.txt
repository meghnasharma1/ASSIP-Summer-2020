Raw, red nail beds glare up at me from the tips of my tired fingers. A faint glow from the oven on the opposite wall tells me it’s eleven thirty-two, and my heartbeat begins to race the tick-tocks of the analogue clock to my left, reaching a pace double that of the second hand’s swift movements. I rub my hands together feverishly, hoping to somehow evade the pain and chill with one instinctual motion. But there is no escape; the cold seeps into my shivering bones and slowly down towards my gently throbbing fingertips…I was twelve the first time I was called to the school counselor’s office for a one-on-one meeting. “Your responses,” she said, in reference to a mental health survey administered the week prior, “indicate that you are experiencing high levels of stress for a girl in seventh grade. Is there anything you would like to discuss?” But there was nothing I wanted to discuss. Rather, I learned two things that day: to circle only “No” on future survey sheets, and to always smile and wave at the counselor in the halls, to assure her that there was no need for me to return. The former was common sense; the latter I learned from the girls who wore long-sleeved gym uniforms to hide sanguine lashes across their wrists, the girls who seemed to exude effortless perfection, but who cried over a photo with few likes and “ate” only lemon water and apple cider vinegar.As the stress of middle school piled up, I found myself becoming increasingly like these girls. The mess of emotions inside my hormonal teenage brain began to sort itself into boxes, some marked for entertaining my family and friends, and others saved only for when I was alone. Anxiety piled up in my brain throughout each day, and burst forth in solitude, manifest by obsessively frequent visits to the bathroom scale and once-skinny jeans hanging loosely around my hips. In time, I too traded in my lunchbox for a water bottle, and even my t-shirts were replaced by hoodies and sweaters to hide my pain. Stress had derailed me. But in a community where every girl seemed to have it worse than the last, I had no idea that anything was wrong.Then, high school hit me like a train.As best I can describe it, high school feels like ice skating down a waterslide; you’re sure to fall down within the first five seconds, but the current continues to launch you forward without the least bit of mercy until the ride is complete. And, to make the metaphor more realistic, you are graded on your ability to remain on one foot throughout the duration of the ride. And the entire slide is on fire. And the water is really gasoline. My first year of high school was marked by missed buses, stress eating, and the worst grades my report card had ever seen. Tears traced melancholy masterpieces on my cheeks each night, and my pillow gradually came to carry enough salt water to brine a turkey. During this time, I developed a rather frustrating habit of tapping my feet on the floor incessantly during times of high stress, which eventually became known as all the time. I lost touch with the girls who had guided me through the past two years, and in my struggle to adapt to this brand new world of unknown straight-A students, I lost myself in its loneliness and anonymity. The boxes of masks I used when performing for others came into constant use, and as I compartmentalized my pains further and further, I began to feel more and more strongly that I was two separate versions of myself rather than one. I was genuinely happy when I spent time with other people, but in the silence of my lonely times, dark and fearsome thoughts overcame me, and rarely did my cheeks remain dry. I keep smiling, but my cheeks grow sore from the effort.I stand uncertainly outside the classroom, examining my hands. The raw, red nail beds almost seem to glow up at me in the effulgent morning light which pervades the hall. “It’s a nasty habit,” my mom always used to say. But there are worse ways to deal with the anxiety building up inside of me each day, begging to be set free. The boxes in my brain are still sorted, but a couple of the masks have grown to collect dust over time as I try to show the world who I really am. The clock on the wall tick-tocks each second, but I slow my breathing to keep my heart at peace. I give my hands one last look, then tuck them neatly into my pockets and take one step towards the door. A teacher walks by. I don’t smile.
