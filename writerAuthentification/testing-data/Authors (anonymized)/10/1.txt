Slowly turning the knob of the Bunsen burner towards me to increase the methane production, I catch a whiff of its tangy stench. My partner holds the flint striker at an angle over the invisible stream of gas, and his fingers force the metal to scrape against itself, creating a spark. Two more attempts and a pillar of fire bursts forth from atop the Bunsen burnerâ€™s opening. I marvel at the seemingly simplistic reaction before me -- combustion -- which powers nearly all of our transportation through the burning of fuel.	In order to be considered a biofuel, a renewable energy source must have a greenhouse gas (GHG) profile at least 20% lower than the nonrenewable fossil fuel it intends to replace (United States, 2017). Ethanol, a biofuel produced by fermenting the starch and sugar components of crops such as corn, grains, and potatoes, is often added to gasoline in order to increase the sustainability and reduce the GHG emissions of the transportation sector and has even been produced using a common Malaysian palm (Hashim et al., 2017; Mofijur et al., 2016). In 2005, the United States Government passed the Renewable Fuel Standard, requiring increasing levels of corn ethanol to replace fossil fuels every year until 2012 because of its reduced direct GHG emissions due to particles with a higher surface area to volume ratio which are easier to filter out (Hergueta et al., 2018; United States, 2017). Two years later, the Revised Renewable Fuel Standard greatly increased the previous corn ethanol mandate from 7.5 billion gallons in 2012 to 36 billions gallons just ten years later (United States, 2017). Ethanol production in the United States has increased from 3.4 to 14.3 billion gallons per year between 2004 and 2014, almost entirely in the form of corn ethanol (United States, 2017). However, the appeals of bio-ethanol may be misleading, as a multiple studies have found evidence that land used to cultivate crops for ethanol production ultimately results in increases GHG emissions as compared to their fossil fuel counterparts (Mofijur et al., 2016; United States, 2017).	Chang, Hwang, and Wu (2017) compared blends of ethanol and gasoline to create fuels which both reduced GHG emissions and efficiently conserved energy using four main biofuels as additives: corn ethanol, switchgrass ethanol, soybean biodiesel, and biohydrogen. Today, standard American gasoline from a pump is called E10 or E15 and contains a blend of 10-15% ethanol with 85-90% gasoline. The researchers found that a blend of 85% switchgrass ethanol and 15% gasoline resulted in the highest reduction of GHG emissions by 59.4%, however, the blend was very energy inefficient with an energy consumption percentage of 101.3% (Chang, 2017). Energy inefficiency in bio-ethanol has made it a less desirable fuel replacement, and higher GHG emissions when life-cycle emissions are factored in may outweigh the most positive impact of ethanol use, besides its preservation of fossil fuels and petroleum (Chang, 2017).	Ethanol is a viable supplement to gasoline; however, it is not a proper replacement fuel. Emission particles from the combustion of ethanol, butanol, and gasoline when used as fuels form different shapes depending on the type of fuel used and in what quantities. A study published in November 2018 found that the particles of GHG emissions produced from ethanol combustion had a significantly higher surface area to volume ratio than the particles produced from either butanol or gasoline combustion (Hergueta, 2018). This research was conducted in order to continue to increase the efficiency of Gasoline Particulate Filters, which filter out particles from the combusted products to prevent them from being released into the air, and a high surface area to volume ratio is preferable in particle emissions for filtration (Hergueta, 2018). Particles are easier to retain if they have a ratio of surface area to volume than if they are large, circular particles like those of ethanol, however, energy is conserved more effectively by gasoline than by ethanol, so a mixture of the two is necessary to balance their benefits (Hashim, 2017; Hergueta, 2018).	A newly approved biofuel fermented from corn fiber may be capable of reducing GHG emissions by 60% when compared to gasoline (Qin, 2018). Corn fiber ethanol can in fact be produced concurrently with corn starch ethanol, currently the most widely used biofuel in the United States (Qin, 2018). Producing two kinds of ethanol side-by-side could potentially reduce life-cycle GHG emissions for both products because the emission cost of growing the crops and maintaining the land would only have to be accounted for once and could be divided between the two products (Qin, 2018). I have been unsuccessful with my previous email attempts, but I reached out to Dr. Qin, the corresponding author of this study, two days ago and am hopeful that I will receive a response because he already sent me this article via email.	Currently, life-cycle GHG emissions from bio-ethanol production may nearly double for decades without the proper preventative techniques, and although there are advantages to the use of ethanol as a fuel source, it cannot serve as a replacement of our nonrenewable fossil fuels and petroleum before we have learned to cut production cost in GHGs. Concurrent production of corn starch and corn fiber ethanols could result in the reduction of life-cycle GHG emissions for each individual product because efficiency is increased for each plant. If we can harvest and ferment more ethanol from each crop of corn for equal or slightly higher GHG emission costs, bio-ethanol mixtures could become a much more environmentally friendly alternative to pure gasoline and could potentially reduce both the environmental and health impacts of GHGs in modern society.
