	This isn’t a bad story, full of tragedy or woe, but I was eight, and hadn’t experienced the world or how other second graders could be cruel unforgiving creatures. In books, little children are full of innocence and have neither bigotry nor cliques. They are not the scheming little monsters they actually are. As all elementary students do, we have recess everyday. A time to run around, play tag, not do math. A time to make obstreperous noise, that my mom could hear all the way from our house. A time when the teachers sit on a bench and talk, for once not worrying what their stupid little rascals were doing on the playground.The center of the playground had several places that everyone wanted to be in. There was the mini-house, with its ceiling tall enough for us, but not any older students. Then there was the red tube. Elevated above the mulch, it always had a faint breeze and omnipresent shade. It was big enough for two kids, three if they squeezed. It was around this time that me and my best friend Alex would rush down to the field to go curl up along the bottom of the tube. We would talk about how much Alex loved my cat, Carter, and how much she wanted a cat for herself, or, which boys were being an idiot in class. One day, when we ran down to the playground, we found that the center of the playground was blocked off by a group of popular kids of our class. The tube was reserved for members of the Asian club. The mini-house was reserved for members of the Asian club. All white kids had to go to the field to play. They were not welcome on the playground. I opened my mouth to argue, my mom was half Japanese after all, but they took one look at me with my brown hair and Alex with her blond, and declared us unwanted and chased us from the playground with sticks and stones. We ran from the playground, crying, for we had never experienced anyone’s schadenfreude before. When I got home, like any little kid faced with a problem, I asked my mom. She told me a similar story from when she was a kid. She was playing on the playground with her friend, but was shocked to find out that the blond kids had declared the best spots to be for blonds only. I asked her what she did. She did nothing.Eventually, they had gotten tired of the best spots on the playground, and were jealous that the brunettes had set up an exciting game of capture the flag. They came down from on high to join the game, and, within a month, all was forgiven and everything had gone back to normal.But my mom was upset. They were a bunch of bullies. And besides, wasn’t this the 21st century? Shouldn’t we be beyond such things? Mom regretted doing nothing in her childhood and called the school. When the response came, we found out that the teachers had seen nothing, but they would be on the look-out for further unwanted behavior. It provided no consolation. They would never see anything. Weeks passed, and finally, Alex and I decided to take our Mom’s advice to heart. It wasn’t worth it to fight people unreasonable enough to ration access to the playground based on race. Besides, what fun would it be to be among the Asian Club? So, we went to the field.The field was large, encircling the playground. It was bounded by the school, the modular, and the horse farm next door. The first day, we sat next to the fence and tried to look for horses. We saw a white one, a dappled grey, and a brown one. All they did was eat grass, and we didn’t have any carrots to feed them, so we lost interest.We tried climbing the termite tree. We tried hiding out in the thorn bush, protected by our shoes and our jeans. We tried looking for caterpillars and butterflies. Then, someone organized North vs. South, a not so realistic reenactment of the Civil War. It was more like a fancy version of capture the flag. Quickly, no one cared about the playground, or Canada as we had started to call it. All we worried about was recruiting and training people to attack anyone stupid enough to side with the evil, slave-owning south (Virginia was a southern state, but it didn’t matter). Eventually, the Asian Club wondered what was going on down on the field. People were having fun, not dying under the heat of the 90 degree weather. They went down to the field to ask what was going on. We wanted to know why some Canadians wanted to join the bloodiest war of American history. The next day, we defeated the South and were enjoying the spoils of war: another marsh, some dusty ground, and some boulders! We rescued the Northerners in the Southern jail. Without any of the bad that comes from war, we had had more fun than we had had the entire rest of the year. They asked to join. They had been mean to us, but we were young and people make mistakes. We let them join the next game of capture the flag (North vs. South was infamous and could never be repeated as we might ruin it). Alex and I returned to our little tube, talking about how cute, soft, and furry Carter was. We forgot about the Asian club. We had our tube back, so what would it matter? Ours wasn’t a tail of tragedy or woe, after all, in a tragedy, the main character always dies. It’s been eight years since two thousand and ten, and though we never go back to the old playground, Alex and I are still friends, talking about why cats are amazing, and why boys are idiots, but also about high school and homework. She takes three APs, and that is the true tragedy of this story.
