Each atom wants to gain a full shell of electrons. To do so, they must either gain electrons, lose electrons, or share electrons. In the moly-mod lab, we used the formulas for various polyatomic ions and small molecules to draw their structural formulas. Depending on the shape of the molecule, the molecule will have different properties, as form determines function. Now fast forward, mosquitoes are more than a nuisance, they kill approximately 584,000 people per year from malaria alone (Wang, Perumalsamy, Wang, & Ahn, 2019). Also, DDT and pyrethroids, which the WHO recommends to use against malaria, are losing effectiveness in killing mosquitoes (Bornman et al., 2018)(Smith, Kasai, & Scott, 2016). Also, DDT interferes with the human endocrine system, making it a last resort in mosquito control (Bornman et al., 2018). Fortunately, researchers have found that secondary metabolites kill mosquitoes while leaving people and pollinators untouched (University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 2015)(Wang et al., 2019). However, which secondary metabolite works the best as a pesticide depends on both its molecular formula and its structural diagram (Wang et al., 2019).	Historically, research on mosquito eradication did not begin until the construction of the Panama Canal (Ferry, 2016). There, because of so many deaths due to yellow fever, the army tasked Dr. Walter Reed with finding the cause–mosquitoes (de Kruif, 1926)(Ferry, 2016). After that, the army poisoned all standing water with small amounts of oil to allow the construction to proceed (Ferry, 2016). In 1939, Swiss chemist Paul Müller discovered DDT’s insecticidal properties (Ferry, 2016). DDT was used until Rachel Carson discovered how biomagnification of DDT killed bald eagles (Ferry, 2016). From then on, when researchers discovered new insecticides, mosquitoes developed resistance, similar to how bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics (Ferry, 2016).	Bornman et al. (2018) did an observational study on how DDT exposure correlated with the amounts of different hormones in the blood in Limpopo province in South Africa. They collected men from villages that either chronically sprayed DDT indoors, or did not (Bornman et al., 2018). They collected information on the participants’ ages, insecticide use, diets, whether they smoked or drank, drug usage, fertility, and BMI (Bornman et al., 2018). They checked for the levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, and testosterone in the blood (Bornman et al., 2018). They also collected semen from the men participating (Bornman et al., 2018). They found that men who lived in villages that sprayed DDT indoors had higher levels of DDT in their blood than men who did not (Bornman et al., 2018). Men with higher levels of DDT had more testosterone but less follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone (Bornman et al., 2018). 	Naik et al. (2018) studied whether a particular virus could alter the genotype of mosquitoes. First, they grew mosquito cells on a complete growth medium so they would multiply, along with antibiotics to prevent bacterial growth (Naik et al., 2018). They also made recombinant baculoviruses with the mCherry gene, which causes phosphorescence (Naik et al., 2018). Genes that cause phosphorescence are commonly used to tell whether a transducing agent actually changed the genotype of the infected cell. They also added several mosquito genes into the recombinant baculoviruses (Naik et al., 2018). Later, they placed the mosquito cells into 24 well plates (Naik et al., 2018). Then, the researchers added baculoviruses at different amounts to the mosquito cells (Naik et al., 2018). After incubating the plates, the researchers added antibodies, then washed away the viruses and antibodies (Naik et al., 2018). The mosquitoes were placed back on petri dishes with complete growth medium (Naik et al., 2018). Then, they checked for the fluorescence brought about by the mCherry gene (Naik et al., 2018). They found some not surprising results, as they increased the amount of virus, the higher the percentage of mosquito cells fluoresced, showing that dosage increased the amount of mosquito cells that had been transduced successfully (Naik et al., 2018). They also found that adding neutralizing antibodies prevent phosphorescence (Naik et al., 2018).	Wang et al. (2019) researched how secondary metabolites could be used against mosquitoes. First, they found a magnolia tree with the help of a certified botanist (Wang et al., 2019). They then separated the secondary metabolites out of the magnolia’s seeds (Wang et al., 2019). Then they used chromatography to determine the structures of various secondary metabolites (Wang et al., 2019). A secondary metabolite is a small molecule that is not necessary for the plant to survive, but instead confers subtle benefits (University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 2015). They then focussed on three secondary metabolites, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and honokiol (Wang et al., 2019). They also grew mosquitoes in the laboratory without exposing them to pesticides (Wang et al., 2019). Wang et al. (2019) then suspended the different secondary metabolites in Triton X-10, a hydrophilic liquid. They then placed mosquito larvae into the different suspensions (Wang et al., 2019). The pesticide temephos was used as a positive control to ensure that the experiment was going smoothly (Wang et al., 2019). After 24 hours, they poked the mosquito larvae to see if they were alive (Wang et al., 2019). Honokiol and linoleic acid proved to be more toxic than temephos (Wang et al., 2019). They also proved toxic against larvae resistant to temephos (Wang et al., 2019). Honokiol did not harm animals in the lab (Wang et al., 2019). This is a filler statement with more information about this experiment because I haven’t heard back yet.	Mosquitoes are not only a nuisance but kill hundreds of thousands of people per year, more people than any other animal (Ferry, 2016)(Wang et al., 2019). However, previous methods of mosquito control resulted in other human health problems (Bornman et al., 2018). With climate change occuring, we can expect mosquito-borne diseases to kill more people in the future (Wang et al., 2019). Right now, the most promising method of killing mosquitoes is using secondary metabolites, which do not harm people or other larger animals (Wang et al., 2019). Secondary metabolites also have multiple active sites, lowering the chance that mosquitoes evolve resistance to them (Wang et al., 2019). However, secondary metabolites might prove more expensive than current insecticides, with Wang et al. (2019) having to go through numerous steps to collect and purify them.
