Each atom wants to gain a full shell of electrons. To do so, they must either gain electrons, lose electrons, or share electrons. In the molecular chart lab, we used the formulas for various polyatomic ions and small molecules to draw their structural formulas. To do this, we used moly-mod kits to attach balls, representing atoms, to each other. Oxygen had two attachment points, carbon had four, etc. Depending on the shape of the molecule, the molecule had different properties, as form determines function. An example of this is secondary metabolites, compounds that are not necessary to an organism, but instead confers subtle benefits, such as pesticidal properties (Pavela, Maggi, Iannarelli, & Benelli, 2016)(University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 2015). However, different secondary metabolites have widely different effects on mosquitoes, depending on their particular structure (Kamaraj et al., 2018)(Wang, Perumalsamy, Wang, & Ahn, 2019). Mosquitoes are more than a nuisance, they kill approximately 584,000 people per year from malaria alone (Wang et al., 2019). Also, DDT and pyrethroids, which the WHO recommends to use against malaria, are losing effectiveness in killing mosquitoes (Bornman et al., 2018)(Smith, Kasai, & Scott, 2016). Also, DDT interferes with the human endocrine system, making it a last resort in mosquito control (Bornman et al., 2018).	Historically, research on mosquito eradication did not begin until the construction of the Panama Canal (Ferry, 2016). There, because of so many deaths due to yellow fever, the army tasked Dr. Walter Reed with finding the cause–mosquitoes (de Kruif, 1926)(Ferry, 2016). After that, the army poisoned all standing water with small amounts of oil to allow the construction to proceed (Ferry, 2016). In 1939, Swiss chemist Paul Müller discovered DDT’s insecticidal properties (Ferry, 2016). DDT was used until Rachel Carson discovered how biomagnification of DDT killed bald eagles (Ferry, 2016). From then on, when researchers discovered new insecticides, mosquitoes developed resistance, similar to how bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics (Ferry, 2016).	Vivekanandhan, Senthil-Nathan, and Shivakumar (2018) dried plant leaves then processed them in a blender. They also cultured mosquito larvae. They then put different amounts of powder into 250 mL of water. After leaving mosquito larvae in the dish for 24 hours, they counted the number of dead larvae.They also added the powders they made to mosquito coils, along with other substances, such as wood dust, which they burned inside a box with adult mosquitoes. They then recorded the number of dead mosquitoes every 10 minutes. Vivekanandhan et al. (2018) found that benzene, a hydrocarbon, produced the highest mortality rate in mosquitoes.  	Kamaraj et al. (2018) studied how secondary metabolites found in ferns affect mosquitoes. Ferns have certain medicinal properties, including anti-cancer, that the researchers felt that they might also have insecticidal properties. They took dried fern leaves and filtered methanol through them. The extract was then concentrated then freeze-dried. They also obtained a culture of mosquitoes. They then diluted the various compounds in tap water and placed mosquitoes into the cups for the preliminary round. Then, they diluted the various secondary metabolites that had an effect on the mosquito larvae to various concentrations. They also tested how the various metabolites affected other species, such as zebrafish, as a form of control. They found that A. radiata, A. caudatum, C. swartzii, H. arifolia, and L. clavatum produced the highest mortality rates while leaving the controls undamaged (Kamaraj et al., 2018). 	Wang et al. (2019) also researched how secondary metabolites could be used against mosquitoes. First, they found appropriate magnolia specimens. They then separated the secondary metabolites out of the magnolia’s seeds. After that they used chromatography to determine the structures of various secondary metabolites. They focussed on three secondary metabolites, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and honokiol. They also grew mosquitoes in the laboratory without exposing them to pesticides. They then suspended the different secondary metabolites in Triton X-10, a hydrophilic liquid. They then placed mosquito larvae into the different suspensions. The pesticide temephos was used as a positive control to ensure that the experiment was going smoothly. After 24 hours, they poked the mosquito larvae to see if they were alive. Honokiol and linoleic acid proved to be more toxic than temephos. They also proved toxic against larvae resistant to temephos. Honokiol did not harm animals in the lab (Wang et al., 2019). This is a filler statement with more information about this experiment because I haven’t heard back yet.	Mosquitoes are not only a nuisance but kill hundreds of thousands of people per year, more people than any other animal (Ferry, 2016)(Wang et al., 2019). However, previous methods of mosquito control resulted in other human health problems (Bornman et al., 2018). With climate change occuring, we can expect mosquito-borne diseases to kill more people in the future (Wang et al., 2019). Right now, the most promising method of killing mosquitoes is using secondary metabolites, which do not harm people or other larger animals (Kamaraj et al., 2018)(Wang et al., 2019). Secondary metabolites also have multiple active sites, lowering the chance that mosquitoes evolve resistance to them (Wang et al., 2019). 	Plants contain molecules called secondary metabolites, some of which have insecticidal properties (Pavela et al., 2016)(Vivekanandhan et al., 2018). Because traditional synthetic pesticides have numerous drawbacks, scientists are constantly looking for new pesticides (Bornman et al., 2018)(Smith et al., 2016)(Wang et al., 2019). Secondary metabolites also have the advantage of not harming people or pollinators (Kamaraj et al., 2018). Therefore, secondary metabolites will prove to be a marvelous solution to many a world problem.
