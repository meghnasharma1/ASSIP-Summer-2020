Soviet oppression: my father had to grow up with it, with his people being looked down upon and beaten. Shoes were a luxury, something we take commonplace in The States. It was a gift for my dad from his parents, and child labor was a prevalent practice in Iran. He needed to leave. He would walk miles, in the burning desert, to sit in scorching classrooms, with aggravating classmates. It paid off in the end, and he got a scholarship to study in America. His hardships have passed down to me but in many different ways.  	Radical Islam, the Iraq war, blood, and death: all the results of 9/11, a saddening and horrific event. After that day, the way middle-eastern Americans were viewed upon changed in paramount ways. It altered the way my dad lived from day to day, but he did not let it stop him from what he wanted to do. I was born a year later, December 7th, 2002. On December 7th, 1941, Japanese-Americans were viewed as a threat and treated as if they were slaves. Similar to the way Middle Eastern-Americans were treated after 9/11. It’s fitting, considering I am Middle-Eastern American and they were going to be treated the same to how Japanese-Americans were in WW2 but to a lesser extent. 	I went to a Christian preschool for a year, which was awkward, considering my parents were Muslims. It was an enlightening experience, as my teachers and classmates were kind. I went to a non-religious pre-school after, and I still had very kind and caring teachers. I avoided much of the oppression I would have gotten otherwise. Elementary school was more of the same, until 3rd grade.	In the summer after 3rd grade, my family went to Iran, and the rift increased tenfold. In America, I was used to freedom, individuality, and independence. In Iran, there was a very heavy family culture, similar to Confucianism. I had to stick to my parents all of the time, and when I was with family, I was treated like a celebrity. Every single kid would come up and ask about America. I knew these guys were my family, but it did not feel like it at all. I felt alone and that I was in a separate reality from my relatives in Iran. 	After I returned to America, I felt unwelcome, a stranger to both places. I did not know where I stood in all of this. This did, for the most part, go away after a month. But there was still that lingering feeling of emptiness and isolation within me. When Obama lifted the Iran sanctions, I felt both more Iranian and American, as America was showing its true colors of being a melting pot of all peoples and cultures, and more Iranian because my relatives would have a more comfortable life. During the 2016 campaign, the amount of hate Trump spewed was an attack on my identity and made me scared to be Iranian, while at the same time making me sick to feel American. When Trump reinstated the sanctions, it put me at more of a divide between who I truly am as a person.	Throughout all of this, my father would clamor about wanting to go back to Iran. He still does to this day. I don’t blame him, even though he experienced many hardships. If he did move back to Iran, I would be in a quagmire. I love my father and everything he has done for me, but Iran isn’t for me. I also only have around two more years to go back to Iran, due to the fact that Iran has conscription for males over eighteen. Part of this is the fact that I am an Iranian citizen, but I do not feel in any way a patriotic duty to Iran, while I do feel one for America; I fully intend to apply to the US Naval Academy in my senior year. It would be the end of a lot of communication with my father, something that would fill me with angst. 	Being Iranian makes me feel American—it’s ironic, I know. But I’ve recently started to speak more Turkmen, something that is a division in Iran, with only the northeast of Iran speaking Turkmen, but it makes me feel more American because I feel unique. Kebab, a very traditional Iranian food, is another part that makes me more individualistic while at the same time connecting me to Iranian culture. I love sharing how Iranian kebab is the best when compared to the other types of kebab. I even know the best restaurants in the area and how to make kebab itself.  I take pride in being called Iranian-American, but I do not like being labeled only American or Iranian because I’m a combination of both, not one or the other.
