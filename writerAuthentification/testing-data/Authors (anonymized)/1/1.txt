In my cold, arid basement, I was working on my 6th-grade science essay, furiously pounding away at my keyboard. After pressing the keyboard for the last time, I stared at the title of the paper, “An Analysis of Thorium Reactors.” My father came down the steps and looked through the paper and had a massive smile on his face and told me this was the best essay I have ever written. My interest in nuclear reactors spiked to an all-time high and persisted throughout my next years in middle school. In the summer after 9th grade, my family took a vacation to Virginia Beach. I begrudgingly came along, and I am glad I did. While passing Norfolk, I stared in awe at the sheer might and size of the US aircraft carriers in port. After doing extra research, I found out that the aircraft carriers used by the US Navy are nuclear powered, and I asked myself if the US navy trusts nuclear reactors, how come the public does not use more of them? I set out to find this out after doing the radiation lab in Mrs. Chhabra’s class.In 1948, the construction of the first nuclear power plant ended in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This was three years after the United States of America unleashed the atomic bomb on the Japanese Empire during World War 2. Out of the many accepted forms of energy production, nuclear power plants were especially after the United States’ Nuclear Regulatory Commission published the Reactor Safety Study in 1975 (Wellock, 2017). When the three-mile incident occurred in 1979, the public’s perception of nuclear power plants fell and fell to an all-time low when the Chernobyl incident happened in 1986. Public opinion did increase after the end of the cold war but tanked after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. FEMA still has the threat of a terrorist nuclear attack ranked remarkably high, with their first emergency scenario is if a nuclear bomb went off in the middle of Washington D.C. using nuclear elements from nuclear power plants (Gale & Armitage, 2018). Another troubling scenario is if terrorists get control of a nuclear power plant (Gale & Armitage, 2018). However, the implementation of proper safety mechanisms can reduce the threat of this to zero. Another means of protecting the populous from nuclear meltdowns is through architectural means. Having independent water storage systems that are separate and detached from the central nuclear power plant will allow for easier resolutions to meltdowns and cases like it. The research proposed shows a diagram which has an independent water storage system attached to multiple values and two lines, one for injecting boron and water into the nuclear power plant and the other as a secondary loop (Gjogiev, Volkanovski, & Sansavini, 2017). This process gives controllers of nuclear power plants lots of flexibility when needing to solve issues during a meltdown or a power blackout. The system proposed is easily scalable for several types of nuclear power plants and allows for simple operation and economic sustainability (Gjorgiev et al., 2017). The final means to approach the question of how to improve safety mechanisms in nuclear reactors is by using the growing field of automation and computer science. Autonomous operation algorithms would allow for increased energy efficiency and a faster response to various reactor emergencies (Lee, Seong, & Kim, 2018). Application of this autonomous system would first start with a function-based hierarchical framework which would outline the various inputs, outputs, components, systems, functions, and goals of the autonomous system (Lee et al., 2018). The number one focus of the autonomous system is to prevent core damage to the reactor core (Lee et al., 2018). The validation of the results showed that the autonomous controlled system performed better than the autonomous and human controlled system (Lee et al., 2018). Scientist correspondence will go here. What this means is that autonomous systems can provide higher safety for nuclear reactors without having a problematic implementation process. Exploration in the field of materials used to house these radioactive elements in nuclear power plants is a very new topic. One of these elements is a “smart alloy” primarily consisting of tungsten but also consists of chromium and a small fraction of yttrium (Litnovsky et al., 2018). This alloy has absorbing properties which allow it to adapt to various heats and temperatures and can allow it to tighten up against these said heats, so it does not melt under these high temperatures (Litnovsky et al., 2018). Used regularly in power plants, tungsten reacts with exceedingly hot temperatures it oxidizes with the air and is extremely volatile and releases an aerosol into the environment which is very toxic to the surrounding ecosystem (Litnovsky et al., 2018). This smart alloy will prevent radiation from leaking out during nuclear meltdowns as well as not posing a threat to the environment while future-proofing reactors. Usage of nuclear reactors globally would allow for the decrease of global carbon emissions at the same time of increased energy output (Dahl, 2018). The next steps in this research process would be to elaborate on this current research and to stem off it, for example, would using 2 autonomous systems at the same time increase overall efficiency? Addressing the concern about the transportation of nuclear waste is very possible with new advances in container technology such as using a custom-designed alloy that avoids the use of zirconium (Ellis, 2018). Answering the questions regarding the topic of fuel efficiency alongside the topic of fusion reactors and their potential energy output could prove to be extremely helpful in the future. Thinking about the future of the US Navy and their aircraft carriers and how they operate nuclear reactors gives me hope that with the correct implementation of the ideas and solutions presented here can provide a better future for all of humanity. Be it from the reduction of meltdowns to the global decrease in carbon dioxide. Nuclear energy research is a field worth pursuing. I will always be going back to the time when my father talked about my 6th-grade science essay, and I want to have that same smile one day in the future.
