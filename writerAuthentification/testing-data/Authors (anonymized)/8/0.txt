Identity. Merriam Webster dictionary defines it as the ‘distinguishing character or personality of an individual’. In other, and more basic words, who you are. Where you’re from. What you believe in.  The essence of you.	My dad, or ‘papa’ in colloquial Indian household usage, was fascinated with the American lifestyle from a young age. He’s often told me, over casual conversation during dinner, and in-depth talks during long road trips, that he was determined to live in America since his 6th grade. He grew up in East India, in one of the most crowded cities in the South Asian subcontinent, Kolkata (then known as Calcutta). Kolkata was, and is today, a dirty, polluted, and jam packed city. However, if you look in the right places, this area of India is one of the most beautiful cities you may ever visit. My dad attended Don Bosco School, named for an Italian Catholic priest who worked to better the lives of children through education in the 19th century. Here, his drive for a better life began.	My dad often tells me how he views the American education of today as far too ‘coddling’. He believes that although the American education system allows for freedom of expression and creativity, it doesn’t promote strict, disciplined learning as much as it should. He tells me how in India, class rank was the most important number in your life when you were in school. Class rank determined how you stack up against your peers, and thus, controlled your future. He tells me how in India, getting smacked on your knuckles with rulers and canes was a daily ritual. He tells me how in India, you got your work done, and you did what you had to do, because that was the only way to succeed. Now, to a large extent, one might say that this form of education doesn’t work as well as it should theoretically. It’s similar to the concept of ‘picking yourself up by your bootstraps’; works in theory, not in practice. Although it spurs motivated learners and pushes them to do as much as possible, it doesn’t always work, and can ignore the real purpose of education: a preparation for the future. Either way, it worked for my dad. He accomplished his dream: coming to America.	My dad entered America on August 19th, 1991. He told me about his difficulties; the lack of reliable information, the ridiculously expensive fees he paid for applications, the immigration process. He persevered through it all, adamant on attaining his goals. He studied Computer Science at Clark University, a private institution in cold Worcester, Massachusetts. I used to think that my father must’ve been exaggerating the extent to which he worked towards his goals. Today, my respect for the struggle my parents faced is greater than anything. He tells me about how while his friends partied, he worked numerous jobs, painting houses during summer, and programming for small companies during the winter. He tells me about how he collected beer cans after the parties ended, and sold the scrap to pay for his education. He tells me about how the hard work he put in was for the success of our family today. 	My dad finished his degree in three and a half years, working hard to pay off his loans at the same time. His hard work has always inspired me, and is a key source of where I get my work ethic from. My dad has always encouraged, and believed in, and pushed me to be the strongest and most successful I can be. In December of 1996, my dad returned to India to marry my mom. As most Indian marriages of the time were, it was arranged by my mom’s and dad’s families. My parents show me photos of their wedding from way back then, and I’m amazed by how far they’ve come today. India is truly a whole different world than America, and to see it side-by-side with photos from my dad’s college years is fascinating. The year my dad married my mother, they moved to the Netherlands. 	My parents describe life in the Netherlands as wonderful. They tell me about the beauty they would see on things as simple as drives to work. A flower shop's windowsill burgeoning with freshly picked tulips from the Dutch countryside. The snaking, loopy canals running outside of their house in The Hague, the city they lived in. The zeitgeist of the times was one of relaxation and beauty in small things. My dad tells me about his first car, a company car, a’97 BMW M3. He tells me about country hopping to the Autobahn in Germany, a day-trip in Europe. My dad tells me about the places he visited with my mom; Spain, England, France. My parents enjoyed spending time exploring rustic little towns full of heritage and culture. They visited the inns and off-the-map destinations. I’d like to think my love of nature and the foreign world comes from them. 	My family moved to America shortly after my brother was born in June of 1999. First, Boston, where I was born, and then Virginia. Life after then has been the same as they say. My family loves our life here. The suburbs are absolutely amazing; living in a neighborhood with room to run around, and my friends so close by is an opportunity I would never give up. Yet, part of me feels as if my parents had it right the first time. My family just enjoys life traveling.
