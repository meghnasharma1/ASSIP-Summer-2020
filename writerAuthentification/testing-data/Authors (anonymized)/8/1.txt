The wavelengths of waves plays a unique role in determining the properties that the wave encompasses. Visible light, which is composed of the waves within the 380 to 740 nanometer range, is what we experimented with in the hydrogen spectrum lab. As soon as we flicked the switch of the power box on, we were able to see vividly the colorful lines representing the numerous colors which make up the visible light wavelength. From this, we were able to learn about the transition in energy of the waves. This transition is what causes a release of energy, producing the colors we then see with our eyes. Although within the same wavelength range, different colors of light possess vastly different properties which can have different effects on human cognition. The two most frequently used lights today in electronics and lightbulbs are known as ‘blue/white light’ and ‘yellow light’ (Fleming, 2018). Blue light, sometimes referred to as white light, is the light that typically proliferates from LED screens used in most electronics today. As handheld tablet and cell phone popularity explodes across the world at rapidly increasing rates, the dangers of sharp, bright screens flooding our eyes with dangerous blue light becomes even more threatening. The use of electronic devices at night has long been known to cause insomnia, restlessness, and other conditions (Harvard Medical School, 2018). However, recent research is beginning to show more worrying symptoms arising from the increasing use of blue light within electronics. Blue light is anecdotally often seen as a sharper and brighter light than its counterpart yellow light, which is found in incandescent light bulbs (Meesters, Dujizer, & Hommes, 2018). As technology has advanced towards the cheap and efficient LED screen, people find themselves staring at a bright, piercing blue light more and more often each evening and night. In fact, the possibly dangerous side effects of blue light versus the softer yellow light are becoming more apparent by the day. Garcia-Saenz et al. (2018) found a statistical correlation between greater exposure to blue light and breast and prostate cancer. Their research found that that men who reported the highest exposure to indoor blue light at night (ALAN) were at a higher risk of prostate cancer, while women who reported the highest exposure to indoor blue light were at a slightly less, but still higher risk of breast cancer than their counterparts with moderate amounts of blue light. They found that exposure to ALAN causes suppression of melatonin production at night, which may be associated with an increased risk of not only breast and prostate, but other types of cancer as well. Although these findings are worrying, they also acknowledge that even if their is a correlation between increased levels of ALAN and increased levels of cancer, the link is weak, and at most, a slightly increased chance versus normal levels of exposure to ALAN. Most scientific studies seem to agree that the most pressing symptom and danger arising from blue light are symptoms such as insomnia, restlessness, and lessened sleep quality.Even though the blue light from electronic devices emitted at night is a cause of insomnia, natural and artificial blue light during the daytime has been found to promote and enhance memory, attention, and academic work (Studer et al., 2019). The researchers at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany conducted their research according and contrary to the circadian rhythm, the inner cycle that dictates your sleep schedule. They found that blue-enriched light enhanced attention during the daytime, while red-enriched light (similar to yellow-enriched light) helped adolescents meditate. The specific benefits of blue-enriched light came when the blue-enriched light treatments occurred in the morning. These treatments caused better performance on math tests and reduced reactions times using randomized computer simulations. The scientists behind the study concluded that blue-enriched light during the daytime is capable of increasing cognitive ability, while red-enriched light during the afternoon and evening assists adolescents with meditation, and sleeping. However, blue-enriched light does the opposite during the evening and night, and worsens sleep quality and cognitive abilities.Although the dangers of nighttime blue light may seem extremely troubling, innovative solutions to the nighttime blue light problem are being researched heavily these days. A research experiment conducted by Shechter, Kim, St-Onge, & Westwood (2018) tested the usage of blue-light blocking lenses before bed. The goal was to increase melatonin production, which is normally suppressed by the use of blue light emitting devices. They measured the effect of the blue-light blocking lenses compared to placebo lenses using different insomnia ranking scales. From their research, they were able to find that the amber-tinted blue light blocking lenses enriched the sleep quality of the people tested on numerous insomnia symptoms. The research mentions the need for further testing with more trials, and better, improved quality lenses, which will enable more blue light blocking at a cheaper cost. They conclude that because of the currently high public rates of insomnia and other restlessness symptoms due to the use of light-emitting devices before bedtime, amber lenses represent an affordable and safe solution to enhance sleep quality. When asked about the next steps in the amber lens research and implementation process, Dr. Shechter (personal communication, February 11th, 2019) said “Placeholder.”  Tinted lenses are a viable and safe solution which we will see being further developed in the future, and possibly used on a wide scale sometime soon. The negative effects of blue light emitting devices are something our society will soon begin to recognize and realize as using electronic devices each and every day steadily becomes the norm. Solutions such as tinted amber lenses and blackout curtains are required in order to preserve sleep quality in adolescents and adults alike. Because sleep, and more widely insomnia, have such great applicability to our world as a whole, more research into blue light and its effects on human cognition is needed. This research will help us maintain sleep quality, and enhance cognitive skills of our society for our future.
