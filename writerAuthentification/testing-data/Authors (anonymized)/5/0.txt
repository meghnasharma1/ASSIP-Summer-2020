With the sound of pelted stones rocking the military shields and pellet guns going off, practically anyone could hear the cry the masked Kashmiri youth were sending out. My uncle adamantly refused to let me go out on the balcony to watch the action occurring right outside my relatives’ house. Instead, we stayed by the window trying to get a first-hand view of the social unrest occurring in the Indian state of Kashmir, or “Indian-occupied Kashmir” as many of the locals like to call it themselves. “Indian-occupied.” Think about that, because I sure did.While I genuinely loved my relatives, I was never a big fan of spending the majority of our summer vacation in my parents homeland. It never made sense to me. Spend a lot of time and money to go halfway across the world to do nothing every other summer. In previous years, we never did much more than sit around and visit some of my parents’ old friends with the exception to a few self-fulfilling trips to the beautiful mountains and valleys in the area. During the spring of 2016, I initially used these points as arguments for why we should stay. My parents basically ignored me as usual since they always had the last word. I am so thankful for that however, because that summer sixteen trip changed my life for years to come.  My paternal family’s house was in a neighborhood, safe from the action between the military and the so-called stone pelters. However, my mom’s side of the family lives in a house right on the main street of a semi-urban area. Although during previous altercations between the youth and the Indian military, the street never saw any sort of quarrels before. It unfortunately escalated extremely quickly where a few of our neighbors became injured and one window was smashed by a rock thrown toward our house. The worst experience I came across within the social unrest was the tear gas the military deployed all over the street, allowing it to fly into the houses despite the closed doors and windows. Because of my family’s demanding me to stay inside, the tear gas only caused me to cough. The people on the streets unfortunately were not able to say the same thing, receiving a much stronger dose. Even with all of this, our street had it light compared to other parts of the state where thousands were getting injured and around 100 Kashmiris were killed. My grandpa and dad told me about Kashmir’s issues with India after my constant bothering out of pure curiosity. Listening to their response about the stories of the last 70 years from when India took over part of Kashmir to the present day, I recognized that my minimal experiences that summer should have almost seemed like a normal week to my cousins still in middle and high school at the time. Their constant struggle struck me into a realization which had never occurred to me. How could the land of my parents, the land which I used to avoid, go through so much in the past 70 years without me wondering or understanding a thing? The past 70 years are the reason the youth of Kashmir, the supposed future, are making the poor decisions to chuck rocks at the military. The past 70 years had unintended far-reaching consequences on outside conditions, negatively disturbing the education system, the environment, and most importantly the future. The aggregate of all these effects caused my parents, who would go to hell and back for their families, to think about the future and their children’s future. At the time, my elder sister was an infant and I had not even been a thought. But they left their jobs for us. They left their families for us. They left their homeland for us. They left their lives for us. For us. Since that summer, I’ve grown to appreciate who I have become as a person. Yeah, I’ve lived my whole life in the USA. I go to a public high school where I run track, I play basketball with my friends, and I spend my Sunday’s watching Redskins football games. But more importantly, my heritage lies in Kashmir: a beautiful land which has been through so much.There’s a somewhat common stereotype, often tossed around as a joke, that all brown people are Indian. Some people take offense, as they should, because they hail from Pakistan, Bangladesh, or really any other country. While my parent’s passports and birth certificates may claim they are from the Republic of India, we sure as hell aren’t Indian. We are Kashmiri. I am Kashmiri.
