The loud pop was impossible to miss. Even though I was expecting to hear the pop as the result of the reaction, the pop still managed to surprise me with its great volume and suddenness. Using the popping sound as a rough measure for the success of our test for hydrogen gas, it was satisfying to hear such the loud pop no matter the shock I was given. While this reaction had an obvious but harmless effect, it made me wonder if hydrogen, one of the most common gases. has such a reaction, then what about other, more toxic compounds? I knew there were thousands upon millions of reactions occurring around us all the time, but I never really took any time to process it in my head. How many of these reactions actually harm the environment without us having a clue? A deeper look and insight into the topic reveals a related major issue for many years now has been the destruction and depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere.	Holes in the ozone layer were first discovered by scientists researching the Antarctic region in 1985 and recognized as an Antarctic phenomenon in 1986 (National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA], 2018). Since then, extensive investigation and experimentation has been performed by a variety of researchers to determine the causes of such an unfortunate natural event. Ozone layer depletion has been attributed to pollution through the use of Ozone depleting substances (ODS’) and Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s), which is much greater than it was a couple of decades ago (Singh & Bhargawa, 2018). Ozone layer depletion allows increased Ultraviolet (UV) radiation level on surface level, which presents an extremely serious threat to human, animal, and ecosystem health (Singh & Bhargawa, 2018).	Human pollution, seemingly the cause of too many recent environmental issues namely global warming, also directly correlates to ozone layer depletion. Singh and Bhargawa (2018) analyzed patterns of the ozone depletion from 1965-2017, narrowing down the different main causes to chlorofluorocarbon emission and a combination of chemical usage grouped as ozone depleting substances. CFC emission stems from industrial use in the refrigerating, air conditioning, and plastic foam businesses (Singh & Bhargawa, 2018). Ozone depleting substances are comprised of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, compounds formed by bromine, fluorine and carbons known as halons, methyl bromide, and carbon tetrachloride (Singh & Bhargawa, 2018). While the specific contributors vary in effect, the compilation of them creates a devastating effect on the ozone layer as demonstrated by the current condition of the ozone layer (Singh & Bhargawa, 2018). 	The plastic industry, specifically plastic bags, is obviously a booming industry however the negative effects towards the ozone outweigh the use. Morales-Mendez and Silva-Rodriguez (2018) studied the chemical products involved in the manufacture which affect the ozone in similar fashion to global warming. Plastic itself doesn’t contain chemicals extremely harmful to the ozone layer, however plastic bags contain additives comprised of heavy metals cadmium and lead (Morales-Mendez & Silva-Rodriguez, 2018).. These heavy metals often bind with elements and compounds such as chlorides and oxides, common compounds in ODS’ and CFC’s (Morales-Mendez & Silva-Rodriguez, 2018). Plastic bag decomposition leads to accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which in turn pushes the ozone from its natural place in the stratosphere to the troposphere (Morales-Mendez & Silva-Rodriguez, 2018). Because of this movement, the ozone layer gets destroyed in the troposphere causing more air pollution which affects the ozone layer in a cyclic manner (Morales-Mendez & Silva-Rodriguez, 2018). 	Since the world agreed to signing the Montreal Protocol in 1987, steps have been taken across the world towards ozone layer recovery. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) split ozone recovery into three separate stages: reduction in the rate of decline, recognizing a significant positive trend, and full recovery, which would ease the stress of the whole process (Krzyścin & Baranowski, 2019). Signs of the first two stages have been discovered across different levels of the ozone layer in stratosphere where ODS concentration seems to have decreased (Krzyścin & Baranowski, 2019). However, this positive trend is not present everywhere yet and certain spots are still experiencing a downward trend meaning the fight isn’t over (Krzyścin & Baranowski, 2019).	The ozone layer has detrimental effects to not just humans, but also animals, plants, and ecosystems across the world. Exposure to great amounts of UV Radiation causes non-melanoma skin cancer and is believed to play a significant role in malignant melanoma development and cataracts, an eye disease. Additionally, extreme levels of radiation stump plant growth, which also upsets the entire environmental chain because herbivore’s food quality significantly decreases directly affecting animal health. Overall, the current solutions to ozone depletion are limited. The recovery path presently only includes limiting the use of ozone depleting substances and CFC’s in order to limit air pollution. The next steps for researchers involve finding a proactive solution in order to expedite the process to alleviate the harmful effects.	Such solutions and a path to recovery have been proposed and there will definitely be additional solution ideas sparked for the many years to come. By analyzing the types of reactions occuring on the ground and in the atmosphere, scientists and researchers have been able to come this far in order to determine the cause as ozone depleting substances and CFC’s, and more work in the field will result in the arrival of a solution. With the lowest levels having been found in the 1990s, the situation has been improving slowly and surely towards full recovery. Now the only question is when?
