?There was one question that we, as a family had been pondering about for a few weeks. “Where would we go for summer vacation?” We deliberated over a few places, but none of them put as many doubts in my head as when mom uttered those dreaded words, “What about India?” I leaped off of the couch and yelled out my inner thoughts, “What! Why India of all places?” She had said what I expected - to meet the family. However, something even more dreadful was about to happen.There are times when mom and dad disagree, and I wished that today was one of those days. Unfortunately, today was not my day. That  dream had been shattered when my dad decided to disappoint me, and agree with my mom. At that moment, I knew that I had lost the battle. You are all probably wondering, “Why don’t you want to go to India?”. Well, It all started when I was not even a year old. My mom and dad took me to India, where I had gotten so sick that I had to be hospitalized. Despite my parents' feeble attempts, the tendency of being  ill in India had continued. However, my tolerance had improved over the years and it wasn’t as horrid as it had been the first time. Over the next few weeks, we prepared for the trip. We bought an ample amount of bug spray, medicine, clothes, etc, and the day came when we had to fly. After what felt like an eternity, we arrived in India. The first thing I noticed was the atrocious smell. Climbing off of the plane and going into the airport, there was this pungent odor, smelling of urine. I immediately closed my nose, yet the stench still navigated through the gaps between my fingers and into it, burning my nostrils and causing me to tear up. My mom gave me the stink eye - you know what I’m talking about. This forced me to keep my mouth shut and not utter a single peep. My grandparents had come to pick us up at the airport. After what seemed like years of hugging and kissing, we finally piled into the small taxi. The long car ride was dreadful, with the only noise coming from the dying radio in the front and the clunking of our bags in the back. We finally reached the apartment, and my brother and I rushed for the sanctuary known as the couch. My feet were still sloshing around in my soaking wet shoes, so I slowly took them off. The honking of horns outside tore through the walls and entered my ears about as loud as the rumbling engine of a snow plow. The pillows seemed to invite my head, so I gently eased it onto them. A sudden feeling of calmness rushed over my whole body like ocean waves rushing onto the shores of the beach.After a well-deserved rest, the whole family chowed down their dinner. My grandparents plopped down in front of the old TV and started watching one of their favorite shows, Indian Idol. My brother and I had the same feeling: boredom. We made the slow walk into the bedroom, with my younger brother trailing behind me. As soon as we reached the room, we felt the sudden arctic breeze on our face as the AC opened its mouth and blew straight onto us. We breathed a sigh of relief as we fumbled for the light switch. We took a seat on the bed and started to play some board games. Before we knew it, we were fast asleep, concluding our first night in India.My parents, knowing how bored we would be, planned many trips around the country. When we heard of this, we were unbelievably ecstatic to get out of the apartment. The first place we journeyed to was Udaipur.Wow, just Wow! That was all I could think.Udaipur was a gem of a city. We toured through the ancient palaces, looking at them in awe. What blew my mind the most was that these palaces were standing since before America was even discovered. I felt a sense of pride knowing that my country, India, had such a rich and vibrant culture. The buildings that were built hundreds of years ago stood through the toughest times and it debunked my personal theory that India never had anything to offer. Growing up in the US and believing all the stories I heard about India had put blinders on me and kept me from seeing the true beauty of this place.Just when I thought I couldn’t be in any more awe, I was once again proven wrong as we approached Mount Abu. What a beautiful mountain! Snow-capped mountains shimmered in the bright sunlight like a mirror reflecting light. I immediately realised that this was no ordinary mountain. As my family and I made our way to the seaside temples, we couldn’t help but glance at the small shops that littered it. Once we reached the temples, I looked up in Admiration, thinking, “This is the true India.” We took off our shoes, and walked up the marble white stairs that led up to the entrance. As soon as we walked inside, I felt like I belonged in this wondrous place. My family walked around, admiring and pointing out the specific details of the temple. My mom told us stories of Hindu mythology, and how it related to the intricate carvings. We prayed and then walked out. When I looked at the lake as I was putting my shoes on, I felt even happier that we chose to go to India.I was certain that it couldn’t get better. As usual though, I was wrong. More and more temples lined the shore of the lake, and each one only got better. Later, we decided to go on a boat ride on the lake. We strapped on life jackets and entered the small yet vibrant boat. The effulgence of the mountain and sun in the clear lake was enough for me to finally put it through my head, India is one of the most beautiful places on earth and I should be proud to be a part of this amazing nation.Unfortunately, all good trips must come to an end. As I board the flight back to the US, a thought strikes me as hard as a baseball bat: I love this place. From the sun-kissed grounds, to the beautiful temples, and even the street food, India didn’t let me down. I am looking forward to the next time we travel here. Overall, India is a marvelous place, and I never should have had any doubts.
