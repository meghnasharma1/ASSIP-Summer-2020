The machine lay on the table, just sitting there. Our teacher put something in there, and all of a sudden, it started beeping. We all turned our heads toward the machine, called Geiger-muller counter, and watched as it kept on beeping. Our teacher explained to us that the Geiger-muller counter detects radiation, and she had put cesium in the machine, causing it to beep, each beep representing the number of disintegrations per half-minute. She then put in various objects in an attempt to block the radiation, an index card, aluminum foil, and lead. The addition of each object reduced the number of beeps until finally, not one noise was made by the counter. After putting everything away, our teacher explained to us the harmful effects of nuclear radiation and why stopping radiation exposure is important. Excessive amounts of radiation not only damage electronics, but are also fatal to living things. To me, this lab made me realize that radiation shielding is a necessity for the safety of those who work in places with high doses of radiation, such as a nuclear power plant.  	Nuclear power is a clean, renewable energy source which has been transforming the world, but it releases a great deal of radiation, and improving current radiation shielding technology is of utmost importance as to make sure working in nuclear power plants is/will be safe. Scientists have been researching the effects of Nuclear radiation for a long time. There are various studies that have linked diseases, some of them fatal, to the exposure to nuclear radiation. To mitigate the effect, they came up with various solutions, building concrete walls with lead around the power plant being one of the most popular ones due to its cost and ease of use. But more recent studies have established a strong connection between various diseases including kidney failure and cancer to lead exposure as well. This has compelled scientists to research new shielding technologies to make nuclear power plants safer than what they are today.	In 2018, scientists in Brazil began researching the radiation dose received by nuclear power plant workers at a nuclear research reactor, Argonauta (Jorge et al., 2018). They began by using computer vision, with the help of the surveillance system, to track workers and the radiation dose they received while working (Jorge et al., 2018). They also used a thermoluminescent detector (TLD), which measures radiation exposure, personal monitors, and Ionization chambers, which measures ionization radiation exposure as well (Jorge et al., 2018). The data obtained from the research was compared to the position ground truth (GT), checking the accuracy and results of the machine to the real world, to determine whether or not the data received was inconclusive (Jorge et al., 2018). The researchers were able to obtain the GT through the manual markers stated above, and the computer vision program created to track the workers provided data close to what the GT provided, proving the data to be reliable (Jorge et al., 2018). The study concluded the radiation received by workers was in low doses; however, the radiation buildup over time can prove to be deadly (Jorge et al., 2018).	In 2019, scientists at Harran University, in Turkey, created a new glass capable of shielding from radiation without the use of lead (Aktas, Yalcin, Dogru, Uzunoglu, & Yilmaz, 2019). They also tested its shielding capability. These scientists created chromium oxide (Cr2O3) doped borosilicate (BS) glass by melting mechanically alloyed Cr2O3 and BS powder (Aktas et al., 2019). Cr2O3 was used due to its physical and chemical properties, as well as its wear-resistant material (Aktas et al., 2019). Borosilicate glasses are used in various technological applications and have selective absorption at certain wavelengths (Aktas et al., 2019). They tested different percentages of chromium oxide, from 0.25% to 5%, in the glasses to determine which percentage serves the best at shielding from radiation, as well as which would be the strongest (Aktas et al., 2019). To test its abilities, the scientists used X-ray diffraction, the scattering of x-rays by the spaced atoms of a crystal, infrared spectroscopy techniques, the interaction of infrared radiation with matter, as well as blasting the glass with photons at energy levels between 22.16-59.54 kilo electron volt (keV), a unit of energy (Aktas et al., 2019). The data found that as the percentage of Cr2O3 in the glass increased, the denser it became, indicating that the strength also increased (Aktas et al., 2019). 5% Cr2O3 doped BS glass was found to have the best radiation shielding ability (Aktas et al., 2019). The scientists had not gone over 5% chromium oxide in the borosilicate glass as the glass would start to lose its transparency, which made it ineffective as glass, so they considered the 5% as the optimal value (B. Aktas, Dr., personal communication, February 5, 2019). The glass is currently being implemented into hospitals and they are attempting to get it into nuclear power plants (Aktas et al., 2019).	Scientists in China have fabricated a polymer composite which is lead-free, shields from radiation, and is flame retardant (Yao-Dong, Jun-Dong, Fan-Chao, Man-Li, & Guo-Hui, 2019). This material was processed in an ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) matrix with magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH)2, zinc borate (ZB), and bismuth oxide, Bi2O3 (Yao-Dong et al., 2019). The materials used were filler materials, and as they increased, the tensile strength of the materials decreased; however, the flame retardancy increased (Yao-Dong et al., 2019). The polymer was then mechanically blended and exposed to different doses of radiation to modify the surface (Yao-Dong et al., 2019). The scientists studied the flame-retardancy and radiation protection properties of the polymer. The data showed the polymer which had been irradiated had better radiation shielding capabilities compared to the polymer which had not been irradiated (Yao-Dong et al., 2019). The flame retardancy was also enhanced due to the irradiation (Yao-Dong et al., 2019). The reason flame retardancy and radiation shielding increased as a result of being irradiated was because the EVA molecules in the polymer formed a higher degree of cross-linking, strengthening the materials and helping improve the performances of it (Yao-Dong et al., 2019). The polymer has a great value for applications not just because of its radiation shielding, but also because of its flame retardancy, which can be very useful in high heat radiation environments, such as nuclear power plants and hospitals (Yao-Dong et al., 2019).	Radiation shielding has many applications, and is not just used in nuclear power plants. Hospitals around the world use radiation shielding techniques to protect patients and doctors from x-rays and other machines. Even sunscreen uses radiation shielding techniques as it reflects UV radiation away from the skin. Improving radiation shielding is important because it involves the health and well being of millions of people around the world, and it would help save future generations as well. The next step in this research process is to figure out ways to not only create physical barriers to shield from radiation, but also clothing and other everyday items that can be used to further protect individuals. There are many questions about various technologies being used- are they reliable, how consistent are they in shielding, what are their breaking points, etc. These questions can only be answered with more research.	Our future is in our own hands, and the only ones who can affect it is us. We all experience radiation everyday, from our phones to our microwaves. While these may be in small doses, it does damage over time, and it is important that we protect ourselves before it is too late. Nuclear power plant accidents may happen, but it is imperative we find technologies to impediment the harmful damages they can cause.
