A couple of years ago, I cooked dinner, took a shower, brushed my teeth, and drank a glass of water, all of which used water delivered through a pipe I had never seen. Later that day, when I was scrolling through my phone, I saw a tweet saying Flint’s water crisis was still ongoing, and I thought to myself, “Wow, I couldn’t imagine if that were me.” Ever since that day, I have always put access to water at the forefront of the list of important issues in the United States, so when I did the drop-drop lab in Chemistry nearly two years later, I was fascinated. The two clear liquids combining to produce a solid immediately drew my thoughts back to the filthy water Flint’s residents had to drink for months on end.	Flint is a city plagued by the same story seen so many times before in the midwest. The state of Michigan, a former powerhouse in manufacturing, has lost much of its economic output with the development of robots capable of doing the work for less money, and Flint was no exception. In April 2014, in an effort to save money, the City of Flint switched its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River, a decision which would change the legacy of the city forever.	About 10 months after the switch, a “ground zero” home was established in Flint. Researchers analyzing 32 water samples found that lead levels had increased from 104 to 707 μg/L over the course of 15 days in January 2015 (Pieper, Tang, & Edwards, 2017). Blood lead data analyzed in September 2015 revealed a dangerous spike in blood lead levels among children. A state of emergency was declared, and public health officials intervened immediately. Researchers immediately began observing pipe conditions around the house and discovered the decision to remove orthophosphate (PO43-) from the water to be the primary cause (Pieper et al., 2017). As orthophosphate flows through the lead pipes, it covers the exposed lead in a protective scale of phosphate (Chain, 2016). After corresponding with Dr. Edwards, a leading researcher in Flint, I was informed the leaded scale is composed of Lead (IV) Phosphate stuck on rust in the iron and maintenance of safe phosphate levels cost around 100$ per day (M.A. Edwards, personal communication, February 3, 2019). When the phosphates are removed from the water, the leaded scale lining the pipe no longer sticks to the rust, letting lead into the water.The primary question to consider in preventative solutions is why there are so many lead pipes in the United States to begin with. One study reviewed the pipe systems in various cities across the United States and found there are an estimated 6.1–10.2 million lead service lines in the United States (Roy & Edwards, 2018). These service lines are responsible for an estimated 50-75% of lead in water. Additionally, a review article from 2016 found the lack of care in the lead pipes was to blame for their ultimate failure (Morckel, 2016). The “out of sight, out of mind” mentality of the residents of Flint was detrimental to the real problem of lead pipes being widespread. Many pipes in the city were over 70 years old at the time of the crisis, but the government saw no reason to replace them, as they seemed to be working fine. These factors all combined in a giant snowball effect which ended with catastrophic results.Lead levels in blood and bones pose a serious public health hazard if not treated immediately. A study on 164 lead-exposed children revealed a strong correlation between elevated blood lead levels and development of ADHD and ODD (oppositional-defiant-disorder) in children aged 3-15 (Lin et al., 2019). Researchers used the VADPRS (Vanderbilt-ADHD-Diagnostic-Parent-Rating Scale) on lead-exposed children to assess whether or not ADHD had developed. Then, they compared the samples of lead in the blood with whether or not they had ADHD using Chi-Square. The P-value found when comparing ADHD and blood lead was 0.025, and the p-value when comparing ADHD and bone lead was 0.022, indicating that lead in the blood or bones has a very detrimental effect on the minds of young children (Lin et al., 2019). When considering the amount of lead in the water, the city of Flint was completely irresponsible in not addressing the lead issue. 	The failure of Flint’s infrastructure is not an outlier, but rather a warning about proper care for water service lines. Water is a resource without which no human can live, and protecting that sanctity is of the utmost importance to ensuring that no other city goes through the same trouble Flint experienced. The primary variable at this point is cost - corrosion inhibitors and grand schemes to uproot infrastructure are simply not feesible. Therefore, future researchers looking into this field could analyze the effectiveness of different corrosion inhibitors on preventing lead contamination, or design a more economic way of replacing old lead pipes to eliminate the public health hazard altogether. The only truly bad solution to the water crisis is inaction.	So, this afternoon, as I washed my hair, cooked my dinner, and brushed my teeth, I felt compelled to think about all the people and all the cities in the world without access to clean water. The simple things I take for granted are so often part of a much larger, more hidden picture that is as far away as Michigan, yet as close as my backyard. As I see it, unless the world addresses this issue with a great sense of urgency, humanity may live in a constant risk of falling into a world without water.
