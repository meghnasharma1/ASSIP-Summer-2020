I left heaven on July 4, 2017. The city of Anchorage, Alaska was the site of my life for as long as my life was within sight. The towering mounds of stone painted with the colors of the seasons had left a permanent mark in my heart that I would not have been able to find in any other place on Earth; and, indeed, it seemed the frozen-over rivers and straits were from a different planet. The city is a melting pot of cultures contained within a bowl of mountains at the fork of the Cook Inlet, so anyone visiting is ravenous for just a taste of the city. Where sky-scraping mountains and mountainous skyscrapers get along in harmony, and the people partition their time scaling the heights of what either one has to offer.Until, with the snap of a car door, the city that offered me so much would let me go.My mother got stationed in Washington, DC shortly after Christmas. I was in eighth grade at the time, and I returned from break with so many plans for the future in mind that I let the present become the past, and before I knew it, my past had passed and my future was flying towards me. And as I watched the world pass me on the way out, an idyllic land lay ahead for me.As my dad drove through the mountains which were laced with winding roads and rest stops, the world outside my car was an expansive ocean of plants, each one untouched by the forces of humanity. Just within view, trees that looked like salad, plants that acted like the wind, roses and fireweeds and beautiful pink wildflowers swarmed my vision. Anyone even a mile off the road would be confined to the forest, left for only the bears and the moose. On this road, unless someone happens to pass you on their way in, the only humans you can see are the ones who are with you in your car. Another hour dwindles, another tree passes, another rest stop, another curve…But this curve is different; we’re not traveling alone.A mother bear with her two cubs trailing closely behind pass our car. No one in the car had ever seen a bear in the wild; the walls that line the city streets in Anchorage always seemed to scare them away. That’s when I realized my family had undergone something incredible when we embarked in our car that day. Never before had I considered that this journey would lead to this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; we watched as the cubs tumbled through the grass and played with each other. As our car exhales exhaust into the clean air, we watch and wonder why these creatures aren’t ubiquitous.	We continue on. Shortly after, we pull up a hill and notice a car stopped at the top as if it were peering down the other side to see how far the drop was. My father eases onto the brakes and we look around to see what debacle has happened at this stop.And we’re greeted by the overwhelming force of nearly fifty bison.When most people imagine bison, they don’t think about Northern Canada as a likely candidate. Kansas? Sure. Dakota? Absolutely. Montana? No question. But that day, did we see bison? Unquestionably. As they trotted along the side of the highway, I think to myself: what could these bison possibly be doing up here? I was dumbfounded until long after the drive was over, when I was struck with a thought: What were we, humans, doing up there?But there we were.We continue on. One hundred miles, then two hundred, and three hundred, each just as beautiful as the last. Green trees, blue skies, grey mountains, and the occasional red flower. I’d been in this car for a day now, passing lake after lake, tree after tree, playing song after song, and I had become fatigued.That is, until I discovered myself riding on the surface of the moon.	I rubbed my blurred eyes and found them staring at a stone behemoth, completely bare and free of vegetation, as if an asteroid had stopped for a visit without making a sound. It cast its shadow over a quarry of rocks on one side of the road and a tree-lined lake on the other. This was where my family would spend the night - tucked inside a lodge on the edge of outer space. 	The next morning, we woke up, ate the breakfast that was flown in for the day and hit the road again. Flat lands and sunny skies awaited us that day; we were almost out of the rockies and back on Earth. As we trudged through the blank canvas land beneath us, I couldn’t help but reminisce on the magic moments, so secluded and out of reach of the rest of humans, as if I was chosen to be the sole viewer of the greatest movie that ever will be. But, alas, as our car neared the final few of the great Alaskan Highway, I realized why the magic was so secret.	We pulled up over another hill, not unlike the one we had viewed the bison on mere days before, and what I saw stunned me: a sprawling town. Not large, but certainly larger than anything I’d seen the past few days. And after spending three years watched over by the comforting mountains, the world was wide open.	But I didn’t feel that open to the new world. This world was made of concrete and metal instead of seeds and time. This world wouldn’t let us get lost in the stars because the stars get lost. This world used to be the world of bison and bears and trees that look like salad and meteors that take naps by the lakeside, until humans moved in. This world was the opposite of the world I had seen before. I looked around at the world I saw then and remembered the universe I had seen before. It was all gone.The highway to hell is a two-lane road. And I left heaven on July 4, 2017.
