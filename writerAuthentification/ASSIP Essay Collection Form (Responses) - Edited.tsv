7/6/2020 15:17:29	Romeo and Juliet was written by William Shakespeare. It is a tragedy involving teen love.Juliet and Romeo both killed themselves in the end.Romeo and Juliet's deaths were caused by their parents' lack of empathy for their children's feelings and Friar Laurence’s bad choices. Romeo and Juliet’s parents put their family feud before their children's feelings. Juliet is a Capulet and Romeo is a Montague and their families do not want them to date or get married because they are opposing powerful families. Montagues are supposed to despise Capulets, but Romeo and Juliet do not care about the feud.“From ancient grudge break to new mutiny.” This quote from the beginning of the book shows how an old meaningful grudge caused two teenagers to die. Friar Laurence’s actions caused Romeo and Juliet’s deaths by his lack of thought. Friar Laurence’s did not think about how his actions would turn out and how they would impact the young teens he had influence over. He did not think his actions through and this caused the teens death.“Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears. Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit. Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.” Friar Laurence said this when Romeo asked him to help him get married to Juliet. Friar Laurence knew how quickly Romeo switched to Juliet after his last love, but he still agreed to help him get married. He did not think about how his actions may hurt Romeo.  Friar Laurence also insulted Romeo a lot and called him womanly. He thought this would stop him from killing himself, but it hurt his feelings and broke their relationship as well.“Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote,” this is what Friar says when Romeo tries to kill himself. Calling Romeo womanly hurt his esteem and makes him feel like Friar Laurence does not have enough empathy for his feelings and emotions. This quick comment really changed their relationship and shows Friar’s bad character trait. Romeo and Juliet’s tragic death was caused by the lack of empathy and thought from the people around them, specifically their parents and Friar Laurence. Their parents did not think about their kids feelings and Friar Laurence did not think about the consequences to his actions. 	The American Dream, the idea that anyone can come to the US and make something of themselves, is what the US was built on. People have been coming from their homelands and have taken risks for the better or for worse. We supported people coming to live in our country, the land of opportunity. Now, we are on the verge of destroying the very essence of what we are. Instead of making it easier to be a part of our country, the presidential administration is thinking of lowering the number of people that can enter our country. When they try to save their lives and their children’s lives, we turn them right back. Our belief system, the idea that everyone can have an equal chance, is being threatened. In the United States many people believe that legal immigration is hurting the economy and job market, but immigration actually supports the U.S. economy. In certain fields of work, such as agriculture and the meat packing industry, finding workers is difficult. In certain areas, like Iowa and southern Minnesota, these workers are a necessity. Even though many times these agricultural areas have less educated people who would fill these jobs, there is still not enough of them to sustain the demand. People also don’t want to do these jobs because it doesn’t appeal to people. Immigrants help fill those jobs and keep those industries alive. According to The Washington Post, “The only threat they pose to us is if they weren’t here.” Immigration can lower the price of both products and services. When immigrants come to the U.S. and take less skilled jobs they get lower pay. This allows the companies to maintain competitive prices of their goods or services due to the low cost labor, which promotes the general economy. Legal Immigrants also pay taxes and this increases the amount of money and support for the government and citizens of the US. When more people pay social security taxes then then the number of people supporting senior citizens increases, which lowers the age dependency ratio. The Wall Street Journal vouches for the need to lower the ratio due to the baby boom population. There is an issue with supporting senior citizens, and more taxpayers will help us overcome this.Immigration also produces jobs. According to The Financial Times, 50% of start up companies last year were founded by immigrants, and 30% of all U.S. based companies are owned by immigrants. Those companies hire workers, which creates jobs. The main goal of immigration should be to better our country and to protect people from dangerous situations. Currently, the easiest way to immigrate is through a family connection, but many times those aren't the people that need to leave their homeland the most. Refugees are people attempting to escape wars and imprisonment for their religious beliefs and other things that US residents take for granted. They try to get their asylum granted. If their asylum is denied, then they can challenge this decision in front of a judge. Many times back ups occur during these processes. In March of 2018, there was a backup of 690,000 cases that were under review for asylum. The US does not allocate enough money to cover all the asylum cases that are brought to court. One way to make the number of asylum cases in court lower is by making more people eligible for asylums. Making asylums easier to receive from the start will lower the number of people challenging the asylum officer’s decision.  Another group of people that should be allowed to immigrate easier and in larger numbers is highly skilled people. Sometimes these are the people who end up starting US based companies. Many iconic companies in the US have been started by immigrants, such as Google and Ebay. According to Google, their company helped 1.5 million businesses make a total of $283 billion dollars in the US just last year. This is a substantial amount of money that helps the US economy. These types of companies help the US, but so do skilled immigrants like doctors and engineers. Having and accepting knowledgeable people in certain fields would promote the general welfare in our country.  Though many people have trouble immigrating to the US, other people have an easier time. According to the National Immigration Forum, 48% of current green card holders have received acceptance because of family sponsorship. U.S. citizens can sponsor their family members to immigrate to the U.S.. Currently, you can bring in your father and/or mother without having to support them in emergencies. Many times,these people won’t help the country and aren't in danger, but are taking other people’s spots and chances to immigrate, and are causing a risk if an emergency happens. If someone can support their direct line family member, they should be allowed to sponsor them and help them immigrate, but they must be ready to take care of them.  Immigration was what started the US, it has increased our population and has helped the U.S.  become the great country it is today. Immigration has powered the US economy due to the new labor pool, increase in taxes, and new companies that have created jobs. Immigration has been front and center in the news lately. Bias and unbiased opinions have been flying, but cutting back on the number of people that can immigrate to the US will only hurt the economy and the essence of the US. Immigration needs to also follow the idea that it ought to help the country or protect people in danger. It should only allow family members  who can support the immigrant, to sponsor them. Immigration is a vital part of our country and cutting back will only negatively impact our economy and the future of the American dream. 	War and winter don't mix, but you have a decision to make. Your 9 month enlistment as a soldier is up, would you re-enlist and brave the cold to help win the war or go home to your family? According to the Background Essay and Winter Quarters, Washington led 1,200 men to Valley Forge. Washington had a option to go home to his wife and the warmth but he stayed with his men through it all. He thought it was unfair if he got warmth and comfort but his men did not. Don't be a sunshine patriot or a summer soldier if you are going to fight at all, you should be there the whole time. A sunshine patriot or a summer soldier means that you only fight in the sunshine or summer. Washington had essays read to his men. A quote from the Crisis America “That the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives everything its value…” This means is if you don't work hard you don't feel as good about it. If you don't fight for the war you don't win the war. Those words were written by Thomas Paine in december of 1776. Thomas Paine also wrote “The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.” He is talking about if you don't face all of the weather you aren't cut for the thanks and appreciation. If you don't do all of it why would you do it at all? If you were worried about dying the Winter Quarters said less than 49% of people in February got sick. Out of those people only 31% died. February is generally a lot colder than December. That is why there is a big drop of numbers between the 3 months. It doesn't seem like a lot when the lows of the month drop by only 2 degrees, but it's the difference between freezing and not freezing. Most of the army survived the winter. Only 300-500 people died per month from illness. There are pros and cons to both sides. Yes, you will be safe in the short term if you leave, but in long term, the British could come and find you. You are less likely to die from disease but you would just die as a person not a hero. An army is a team. If people don't work together you can't accomplish much. People are better together because if one person is fighting a whole army they are likely to lose. Instead of a whole army against another army. Then it's a equal battle. You are not always going to win every battle or war. If you win, you get all of the glory and get to be a hero. If you lose, you could get in big trouble. Britain would most likely send people to watch you and make sure you don't try anything again. Once you fight on one side it's hard to go to the other. That is because you are labeled a traitor, a disgrace, a savage, and all sorts of other things. Overall the pros and cons of both sides are about equal. But, it's better to die a hero than die as a person. Everything in a nutshell is that if you don't work for it you don't receive it. In order to receive the thanks and honor you must complete the task. Leaving or deserting the army or your team is like being a traitor, you are leaving when the army needs you the most. Also, if you start something you should finish it. What's the point of half of a drawing? It's not complete if you don't finish the other half. It's the same thing being a sunshine patriot or a summer soldier.  	Have you ever thought what would have happened to America if the Confederates won the Civil war? Well that could have happened if the Union hadn’t won the battle at Gettysburg! Gettysburg was a little town in Pennsylvania before the date of July 1 of 1863, on that day it became the setting of a crucial battle. It’s casualties were gruesome and horrid, but the victory was glorious. Gettysburg changed the civil war and impacted America in many different ways.The first result of the Battle of Gettysburg that made it a turning point was because it was the end of hope to having a confederate states of America. This meant that the hopes of having the Confederacy run the country was over. According to the National Park Service “The fate of the nation literally hung in the balance that summer” which means that this battle would highly influence the civil war. People believed this would be a obvious and decisive victory for the Confederacy, but it wasn’t. It ended up causing the Confederacy to flea Gettysburg. The second result of the Battle of Gettysburg that made it a turning point was that the confederacy lost many men. According to the letters that Robert.E Lee sent to Jefferson Davis and the estimated casualties chart they lost many “valuable officers and men,” as Robert E.Lee calls them. The confederacy already had a limited amount of men and losing roughly 34% of their army didn’t help. At this point in the war each soldier counted and losing more than 20,000 soldiers was very important and a big issue.This demonstrates that Gettysburg should be considered a turning point because it caused the Confederacy to have less men for the battle to come. The third result of the Battle of Gettysburg that made it a turning point was because many people in the South lost hope in Robert E.Lee which caused the North to believe they could win. After the loss at Gettysburg many people including E.Lee where disappointed with what happened at Gettysburg. The letters that Robert E. Lee sent to Jefferson Davis show that there was “discontent in the public journals at the result of the expedition,” after the battle Lee asked the Confederate President Jefferson Davis if he could resign, Davis did not accept Lee’s plea. Also according to the background essay “Lee was making every Northern general he fought look foolish” due to this battle Lee’s winning streak was over and many Southerners were crushed and very disappointed.This demonstrates that Gettysburg should be considered a turning point because due to the Gettysburg battle Lee lost hope in himself as did other people and the question that the background essay brought up of “Who would stop Lee?” was answered.Gettysburg was a turning point in the war due to many things that all influenced the outcome of the civil war. It was the end to the hopes of having a Confederate states of America, the Confederacy lost many men and they lost hope in Robert E. Lee. This all influenced the way the Civil war ended and are all very important. 			
7/6/2020 15:17:53	As members of Generation Z, we know that there are just certain events in our lifetime that we will remember forever. We are the generation that was born into the new digital age and it was up to us to adapt to it. From learning how to use social media as a way to reach out to our community and using technology in our education during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have easily adapted to the constant innovation around us. However, this ability of ours to adapt to all types of scenarios has the potential to become one of our fatal flaws as a generation. We are one of the many generations that have been exposed to systemic racism in the United States of America and we were taught to avoid trouble, keep our head down, and walk away.  Currently, there are protests going on around us in major cities like Minneapolis, Washington D.C, New York City, Atlanta, Los Angeles and more to get justice for black people like Tony McDade, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and so many more. Many of these protests start out peacefully and show how not only African Americans are coming together to support the Black Lives Matter movement but also Asian people, Indian people, White people, Indigenous populations, Hispanic and Latino populations, and the LGBTQ+ community - just to name a few. This unity, if we can maintain it, is extremely promising; it is something our generation has never seen before. The only way we can expect to fix a problem that is about the brutality in our community due to outdated views on the divisions between our society is to approach the problem united, not divided. This said, there is a difference between peaceful protests and violent protests. I understand that desperate times call for desperate measures and if we are met with violence, sometimes we have no choice but to respond with violence to defend ourselves. However, the protests that started with violence are not reflective of the movement as a whole and should not be what we aim to model in our future demonstrations. Instead of letting people who support the crimes of our law enforcement talk about how aggressive our movement is, we should let our words speak for us and the inhumane actions that the police have been taking speak for them. Although the reason for why so many people are so angry is understandable, history has shown us that racism will not fix itself overnight and that attempting to instill fear in the police and in our government so that we get our way will only hinder our cause and reduce the support for it. Peaceful protesters will not come to the streets if they are scared for their lives. Our elected officials will take any chance not to hear us if our cities are burning and they have to spend time figuring out how to rebuild cities instead of spending time listening to their constituents. For those who believe that they have screamed and shouted with no results, the biggest way we can make a difference is to vote for new leaders who will listen to us. There are times when we are not going to get heard but instead of stopping or postponing the discussion about race, it is our job to keep on talking about it instead. We will not be able to get our point across about race and how it is tearing the seams of our nation and our people apart if we are not persistent in fighting for racism to be squashed.Trends come and go, but oppression is systemic. Segregation did not end with the romanticized court cases they teach in history, as red-lining oppresses many day by day. Slavery did not end with Lincoln’s efforts but evolved into our modern day prison system. History has adapted and hid, but will never stop. These moments where we stand together to fight for something that is not a political issue, but a human one should never stop as well. We came together for the March for Our Lives, but those same people who only spoke up when celebrities started endorsing it are again quiet now. They will speak now when the whole world is united, but in a few weeks will forget the events in Minneapolis. Social media has made it so we have a permanent digital footprint to never forget. This anger and sadness and passion that you all feel now, should inspire you everyday. “Racism is not getting worse, it is getting filmed.” - Will Smith. We have evolved from relying on newspapers and TV channels to tell us when injustice has happened. Now we broadstream it on Twitter and demand change. This generation has the capability to not let the fight for freedom become a yearly movement, but an everyday movement. Don’t get me wrong, not everyone owes it to the world to be on the front lines and march or post on media, and this is not a call to action. It is instead a reminder that we have a say and we have the biggest online outlet to get our voices heard, to educate and inspire others, to adapt and evolve. As we were born into the social media age, we were also born with this public outlet to share opinions, connect, and communicate with others on a large scale. Day to day posts may vary, but whenever there is an important day we are the generation to take to the platforms and spread awareness. But with this type of mass audience, we have all developed a separate identity and subsequently behavior and culture in our online presence. Talking about serious issues, on Instagram and such, can domino into a pressured string of people who post to make it clear to other people that they are present and aware. While intentions may be pure for some, this act of mindlessly reposting, tagging and sharing a black screen with a slogan is not going to help. More than that, others are coerced into sharing it for their social image which results in an ignorant bandwagon instead of garnering true support. Things like this, or other non-quantifiable sharing, such as just art of the victims or quotes or the simple text of “stop racism!” can spread awareness at first but then it builds into useless clutter. It is hard to know how to react, what to say, what to post, and what to share. There are no set in stone rules, and there might never be any. Each person has a different following and community reach, and while you may pour your heart out to those 100 or 1000 or 10,000 people, there are senators to message or call, petitions to sign, organizations to donate to etc. It may not be and certainly isn't fair to expect anyone with a following to know how to react to these situations, as that same social media pressure is still prevalent in celebrities, but as the world is changing we have to adapt and be role models. So, even though it is admirable to want to inspire change, the most influential way other than changing the system is personally communicating to other individuals. We often lose sight of the power of an educated conversation when so much of our lives has been autoset to mindlessly follow the majority. The name of our generation contains the last letter of the alphabet, “Z”, so let us make it our mission to be the last generation that has to undergo the pain and anger caused by racism.  	The purpose of this lab was to use collisions to demonstrate the conservation of momentum quantitatively and study the transfer of energy. We know that for momentum to be conserved the mass * velocity on both sides of the equation should be equal to each other, which numerically means one - the other carts data should = zero. We conducted 6 trials for each of the collision types: Purely Elastic, Completely Inelastic, Explosion, 3 with an equal amount of mass on the lab carts, we simply had none added on, and 3 with an unequal amount between the carts, we added .244kg to the blue cart every time. Our lab data from Trial 1-3 from the Purely Elastic Equal Mass Collision had an Impulse or delta momentum around-.08 where as Unequal Mass was usually more variable averaging around -.04. When the mass increases, in order to prove the conservation of momentum the velocity should decrease respectively so that objects values balance out with the other. So we would expect the unequal mass momentum to have been relatively closer, however the velocity for those 3 trials were higher than the first 3. When looking at Final Delta Momentum, In regards to the other cart in the unequal mass trials, the values remain in the hundreds places meaning momentum was still relatively conserved. This same situation and decimal places for momentum happened for the Completely Inelastic collisions, which was unexpected but seeing as the blue cart, the one with additional mass, was also the one that we pushed towards the other carts in those two collisions. Which explains the larger velocity. All of the trials ended with a Delta Final Momentum in the hundreds or rarely the thousands places, which happened for the equal mass purely elastic collision as the velocities were relatively much closer. The momentum values being so low means that momentum was relatively conserved with a margin of error around +- 0.05. Overall I expected the equal mass trials to have a lower margin of error as conservation of momentum might be more accurate when mass isn;t also a varying variable. Additionally out of the three collisions I expected the explosion to be most accurate in representing the conservation of momentum as both carts start from rest. Overall the delta energy data had the trend of higher delta kinetic energy in the Explosion collision with values around 0.04 for both carts while purely elastic was around 0.02 and completely inelastic around 0.01-0.02. The one collision that really showed the conservation of energy was purely elastic as its delta energy of the system values were in the thousands meaning a 0.005 margin of error, only for the equal mass trials as for any collision adding mass increases kinetic energy. Overall all of the collision types exhibited a conservation of momentum, which was relatively expected. In the future maybe more trials could be conducted switching which cart pushes towards the other one and there could be a better analysis for the values resulting from that.  					
7/6/2020 15:24:47	After the beginning of the market revolution, America’s population increased rapidly. With the creation of new technologies and the increasing interconnectedness of America by the telegraph and the railroad, America was looking for new land to expand. Henry Clay’s American System helped build the infrastructure for the transportation of food from the west and for the transportation of new settlers to the west. Due to the new economic opportunities in the west, many Americans from the North and South decided to migrate west during America’s westward expansion. In the period 1830 to 1905, the ideas of Manifest Destiny were a major motivation for the expansion of the United States, expansion was also motivated by the need to spread democracy and American values abroad. The idea that it was America’s god-given duty to expand was the greatest factor in the expansion of the United States. Initially, this idea of Manifest Destiny was used by Americans to legitimize westward expansion. In Document 2, the idea of Manifest Destiny is used to describe America’s right to all of the territory on the North American Continent. Although this speech was given to the House of Representatives, the true audience of this speech was the American people and shows that the idea of Manifest Destiny was a popular belief during the time period. Like Document 2, Document 3 uses the idea of Manifest Destiny to legitimize expansion by suggesting that the Transcontinental Railroad was a necessity in order to fulfill America’s need to expand. Although the idea of Manifest Destiny was initially used to justify westward expansion, it was later used to justify expansion overseas. Document 5 shows a powerless Aguinaldo attempting to stop the US occupation of the Philippines. The purpose of this document is to highlight the fact that the US expansion into the Philippines was detrimental to the Filipino people. The idea of Manifest Destiny led the United States into expansion into places, like the Philippines, against the will of the residents of those territories. Although the ideas of Manifest Destiny were the biggest motivation for expansion, the American people’s need to spread democracy and their values abroad were another motivation. One example of this idea is the US government’s treatment of Native Americans and can be seen in Document 1. Document 1 is a speech by Andrew Jackson, speaking to Native Americans as a whole where he highlights the fact that the goal of the US government was to integrate Native Americans into American society. One way that the US government was able to accomplish this goal was through the Dawes Severalty Act. The Dawes Severalty Act broke up communal Native American lands into plots for individual Native American families. There was also a push to teach Native American the American lifestyle, which was done by forcing them to go to American schools. Another example of expansion motivated by the need to spread American values was America’s treatment of Cuba during the Spanish-American War. The war itself was fought in order to spread democracy and liberate peoples under Spanish tyranny and this was largely the case in Cuba. For this reason, Congress passed the Teller Amendment which stated that America would not annex Cuba after the war. Although initially focused on spreading democracy, America’s belief in Manifest Destiny later changed the war’s focus and led to the passing of the Platt Amendment which gave the US greater control over Cuba and limited Cuba’s freedom. 	What should be the goal of society? Are the interests of the many more important than the rights of the individual? These two questions are explored in-depth in Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The novel follows a young boy by the name of Huck Finn on his journey down the Mississippi river. Along the way he witnesses many events that change his view of the world. Many of these events are centered around death. Death is a major symbol used by Twain throughout the novel. From the very beginning, he uses death to satirize society and critique its flaws. In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Twain uses death as a symbol for the failure of society, suggesting that society serves to promote the good of the majority at the expense of the individual. In the chapter “I Light Out in the Storm,” Twain uses the death of Peter Wilkes to emphasize that society does not respect its members’ individual rights when it is disadvantageous to the majority. In the chapter, a mob forms in order to exhume the body of Peter Wilkes after a dispute over who his true brothers are. The mob detain Huck, the king, and the duke, but upon catching sight of the gold that was hidden with Peter’s corpse, accidentally release the trio in order to divy up the newfound treasure. Although, initially the mob was formed with the righteous intention of seeking justice for Peter Wilkes, the members of the mob were blinded by their own greed and let the fraudsters get away. Twain uses this to argue that majority rule has an inherent flaw: that the majority will blindly act in their own self-interest which can disenfranchise the minority. He highlights this blind selfishness through the symbolism of the townspeople forgetting their lanterns yet bringing too many shovels. Twain also uses the character of Hines comment on society. He portrays Hines as self-centered and throughtless through his treatment of Huck. Although he was the one who detained Huck, his excitement causes him to forget Huck is even with him and, after he lays eyes on Peter’s gold, he lets go of Huck altogether, showing what truly matters to him. Deep down, members of society care less about finding justice for Peter and more about their own gains. Similarly, the death of Boggs in the chapters “An Arkansaw Difficulty” and “Why the Lynching Bee Failed” is used by Twain to suggest that civillized society can be used to legitimize immoral behavior as long as it benefits the majority. In these two chapters, a drunk named Boggs is murdered in the street by an old colonel named Sherburn. After the murder, the town decides to lynch Sherburn and rushes to his house. After a short speech by Sherburn about the cowardice of the mob, the mob dissiperses. In this section of the novel, the town treats death as a source of entertainment showing a lack of respect for the dead. Mere hours after the shooting, the townspeople are acting out Bogg’s murder for the entertainemnt of others. On top of this, the lynch mob that forms is not motivated by a sense of justice but by boredom. In previous chapters, we see the people of the town depicted as unemployed, tobacco-chewing loiterers. Their only form of entertainment is abusing animals. Twain uses the lack of respect of the dead and vile portrayal of the townspeople to argue that society can be hijacked by many ill-intentioned members to commit immoral acts. He believes that it is morally wrong for an ill-intentioned majority to be able to disadvantage individuals for its own personal interests. This is why Sherburn asserts that members of a mob are cowards and that true men would take responsibility for their actions. Twain believes that instead of protecting the wellbeing of all its constituents, society allows members of the majority to indulge in immoral behavior that they otherwise  In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Twain criticizes society's shortcomings arguing that it can be hijacked by the powerful to take advantage of the weak. He believes that people should have to take responsibility for their actions individually and that they should not abuse society for their own gain. Having lived through Reconstruction, Twain would have been able to see first-hand the use of society by the powerful for their own personal gain. In the North, wealthy business tycoons and corrupt politicians used their power to take advantage of the working class. In the South, the white majority used their power to disenfranchise the African American minority. Using The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Twain critiques the flaws in these two societies, showing that the North and the South are not that different after all.	After the Progressive Era, American society experienced a major cultural change. African-Americans acquired new rights, the roles of women were altered, and the views of everyday Americans became more progressive. Industrialization led to the growth of large cities and a greater focus on manufacturing instead of agriculture. Culturally, America was on the verge of major advances in jazz, modernist literature and social justice. The cultural changes that America experienced between 1914 and 1945 were largely due to the invention of new technologies as well as domestic and foreign migration. New technologies greatly changed the American way of life. Home appliances allowed women to focus less of their time on housework and more time on their true passions. This pushed many women to fight gender discrimination by working in male-dominated fields. This is shown by Document 3, which was written by Fannie Hurst to persuade its readers that women should not be relegated to the kitchen and that they should work in fields best suited to their talents. Other technologies such as the radio and television changed how Americans entertained themselves and how they got their news. While before politicians could only communicate to their constituents through print, Americans were now able to hear and see the politicians themselves. FDR saw the merits of this new form of media and began to broadcast his “fireside chats” on radio. This allowed him to reach a much larger audience than any newspaper could. Although this new media was largely beneficial, it did not come without its downsides. Many people believed that it would lead to apathy towards politics and cause Americans to forget their responsibilities as citizens (Document 4). Another way that American culture changed during this time period was through migration. Domestically, America experienced what is known as “the Great Migration” which saw many southern African-Americans move North in search of jobs and a more equitable society (Document 1). When they moved, many of these African-Americans brought their culture with them and helped integrate it into American culture. During this time, there was also large amounts of foreign immigration. Immigrants from all over the world traveled to America in search of economic prosperity and freedom. These immigrants brought their culture with them when they traveled and helped enrich American culture with elements of theirs. Many of these immigrants experienced discrimination, especially from unskilled workers who saw them as a threat to their livelyhood. The illustrator of Document 2 likely held these racist sentiments towards foreigners which is why he decided to illustrate them with a bomb for a head. He likely hoped to persuade his readers to support restricting immigration as he views it as detrimental to America. This popular sentiment led to immigrants creating their own communities in major cities, such as New York, instead of fully assimilating with American culture. 	In my dining room hang many pictures capturing notable moments in my family’s lives: birthday parties, family vacations, and a couple graduations. However, in my eyes, the most important picture is not one of me. In fact, its importance stems from the very fact that I am not in it. The photo is one I took of my twin brother, his sponsor and the bishop at my brother’s Confirmation, an important rite of passage in the Catholic faith. To an outside observer, the photo looks just like any of the other photos that hang in my dining room, but, to me, the photo is the culmination of one of my life’s hardest struggles: my struggle with my faith. For most of my childhood, I appeared to be your typical Catholic. I went to church every Sunday, attended Catholic community events, and even played on a church-sponsored basketball team. The people that I was closest too, including my family, were all Catholic. I went to Sunday School and enjoyed doing volunteer work. However, as I began to approach my Confirmation, I realized that I had serious doubts about my faith. Unlike my elementary school, most of the people at my middle school were not Catholic and the few who were rarely spoke about it. My hobbies had changed after I realized my passion for science and began participating in more science-related activities. My social circles started to shift and I began to make friends with people from different backgrounds. With all this change, my beliefs began to be challenged and I realized that I had serious doubts about my faith. While preparing for my Confirmation, I realized that I could not go through with it. Having been raised in the religion, I appreciated the importance of Confirmation to Catholics and felt that receiving it half-heartedly would be disrespectful to real believers. Even though I knew that nobody would know about my transgression, I still respected the members of the Catholic Church and did not want to disregard their sacred traditions. Deep down, I knew that, for me, getting confirmed was the wrong thing to do. The choice to not go through with my Confirmation was not an easy one. Even though I had started to make friends with people from different backgrounds, the people closest to me were still mainly Catholic. I had made many of my friends at church picnics and pancake breakfasts. Both of my parents were devout Catholics, and I knew that they would have a hard time coming to grips with my decision. Although they took it better than I expected, they still asked me to discuss my choice with a myriad of spiritual leaders: priests, deacons, and even the head of my Sunday School. I agreed to my parents’ request out of respect for them. During these discussions, I began to see the varied beliefs that Catholics have: some use a looser interpretation of the Church’s teachings while others are more strict. One Catholic might believe that all forms of lying are serious sins, as they go against the ninth Commandment, but another might believe that, if it benefits others, lying is the moral thing to do, as it follows the general message of Jesus’ teachings. Listening to these diverse opinions, I realized that none of them truly satisfied the questions that I had. Each person had their own, personal answer and were able to support it with some aspect of Catholic theology. It was at that point that I decided not to call myself a Catholic. It is impossible to communicate all of a person’s religious beliefs, with all their intricacy and nuance, with just one label. Every person has their own unique spiritual ideas which should not be simplified down to one classifying phrase. Labels only serve to highlight the minute, unimportant differences between people instead of focusing on what they share. They are used as a tool to otherize groups or individuals to the point that they cannot be empathized with. People are more than just the names that they are called.	Preceded by the war of 1812, the Antebellum period was a time period in US history which saw an increased focus on bringing about a more equitable and democratic society. Due to the Hartford Convention and their threat to secede from the US, the Federalist party had lost its credibility and was no longer a national party. This meant an increase in national unity and a general stability for the first part of the time period. Later, the country would begin to unravel as increased sectionalism increased tensions leading to the Civil War. During the Antebellum period, American society changed to the extent that it brought about greater religious diversity and a push for a more equitable and democratic society while discrimination against traditionally marginalized groups, such as Native Americans and African-Americans, continued. The Antebellum period in American history was one that radical religious and social change. Due to the Second Great Awakening, Americans had already begun to be more accepting of new ways of interpreting scripture thanks to ministers such as Charles Finney. As shown in Document 1, Finney preached that peoples’ choices were what determined their fate instead. This was much different than the beliefs of other Protestant groups that believed that the fate of humans was already determined through a process called “predestination.” Because of this belief that a person’s choices and actions were what lead them to salvation, many Americans saw it as their religious duty to bring about positive social change. Many devoted themselves to reform movements such as abolition and women's rights which brought about a change in the traditional roles of these marginalized groups. This change is addressed in Document 3. Document 3 is an excerpt from the Declaration of Sentiments, which was written by women’s rights advocates to highlight the unequal treatment of women by American society at that time. It was a major part of the women’s rights movement and helped bring about a change in the role of women in society. This time period also brought about an increase in democracy as more Americans were able to participate in their government. Document 4 illustrates this idea showing that voter participation increased significantly during this time period. Although there were positive changes in American society, discrimination against traditionally marginalized groups continued. One such group was African-Americans. During this time period, many African-Americans were slaves and were forced to work against their will. Although there was a new wave of reform movements sweeping the nation and Americans were enjoying greater freedom, slavery was not abolished. Document 5 touches on this idea. Fredrick Douglass wrote this document in order to show the hypocrisy of Americans owning slaves. He believes that it is hypocritical for America to fight for greater rights for white people while those white people still own slaves. Like African-Americans, Native Americans experienced hardships during this time as well. Thanks to leaders such as Andrew Jackson, Native Americans were pushed off of their tribal lands and forced to move west. One major example of this was the Trail of Tears which saw many Native Americans die from starvation and disease as they were forced westward by the US government. This treatment of Native Americans was a continuation of the poor treatment of Native Americans by the US government in order to benefit Americans. 	The Progressive movement was a time period in American history that was largely influenced by the decades before it. In the decades prior, the federal government tended to side with big business instead of labourers and saw a rapid increase in industrialization. Americans reacted to these events by electing officials with more sympathetic views towards labor and helped urge their elected officials to interfere in business by breaking up monopolies. In addition, the failure of Reconstruction to provide a discrimination-free world for African-Americans and passage of laws restricing immigration such as the Chinese Exclusion Act made it difficult to change the views of Americans towards these marginalized groups during the Progressive Era.The Progressive movement in the United States helped root out corruption, increase government oversight of industry, and increase participation in government by everyday citizens, but was unable to create positive change for certain traditionally marginalized groups. One major aspect of the Progressive Era was the change that it had on American government. Thanks to the progressives, many new political ideas such as recall, initiative and referendum gave everyday Americans a greater control over their elected officials. Document 4 references these new ideas. The purpose of the document was to show their audience that these new ideas would help increase democracy and solve some of the problems that they were facing. Similarly, Document 1 discusses how a certain government official was able to maintain his position despite his ineptitude. He used his political power as a bargaining chip for the votes of his constituents. Corruption like this was a major problem in cities that progressives were largely able to solve. Part of the solution to the corruption in government came with president Arthur’s Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. This law helped destroy the “spoil system” that saw government positions doled out to the supporters of an elected official. It forced the positions to go to people that were fit for the jobs instead of an official’s supporters. Another major change was the government’s new role in overseeing industry. Thanks to progressives such as Theodore Roosevelt, large trusts were broken up to increase economic competition and bring about fair prices. Document 2 shows the sentiment of progressives towards government interference in industry; they believe it is the government’s duty to stop unfair market practices. Although the Progressive movement managed to bring about major changes to American government, it was unsuccessful in bringing about change for certain minorities. One group that saw little change during this time was African-Americans. Because the progressive movement was largely made up of white, middle-class Americans, there was little done to end segregation. This is touched upon in Document 5. The purpose of Document 5 is to persuade president Wilson to end segregation in the federal government. Although African-Americans were no longer enslaved, they still faced discrimination and were unfairly segregated. This was because of the case Plessy v. Ferguson which allowed for “separate but equal” treatment of African-Americans. Like African-Americans, the discrimination that immigrants faced was largely unchanged by the Progressive movement. After world war I, there was an increase in xenophobia against certain groups of immigrants. Many Americans began to fear immigrants because they saw them as anarchist communists. Because of this, many were unfairly deported or arrested. One of the most famous instances of this occurred during the Palmer Raids which saw many Eastern Europeans arrested and deported due to the belief that they were part of a plot to overthrow America. 	Should individuals have sympathy for wrongdoers? This is the question that is explored in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter,a Dark Romantic novel set in a Puritain town in New England. In the novel, Arthur Dimmesdale, the town’s young minister, is seen as a bastion of morality by his community, but, deep down, suffers from the guilt of committing a heinous crime. Dimmesdale is unable to confess to his crimes as he believes that, if he were to confess, his community would lose all respect for him. However, at the end of the novel, when the illusion is broken and reality is revealed, the town gains a newfound respect for their minister. In The Scarlet Letter, Hathorne uses the destruction of the illusion of Dimmesdale as a sinless and absolutely moral minster by his community to suggest that individuals have respect and sympathy for repentant wrongdoers as it is human nature to commit immoral acts. In the chapter “The Minister’s Vigil,” the unorderly appearances of the community in Dimmesdale’s vision are used by Hawthorne to suggest that nobody, regardless of class or social standing, is without sin. In this chapter, Dimmesdale decides to stand on the town’s scaffold to attempt to relieve himself of the unbearable guilt that he carries from his act of adultery with Hester. While on the scaffold, he has a vision of the community coming out to see him. Hawthorne writes: “A dusky tumult would flap its wings from one house to another. Then…old patriarchs would rise up in great haste, each in his flannel gown, and matronly dames, without pausing to put off their night gear. The whole tribe of decorous personages who had never heretofore been seen with a single hair of their heads awry would start into public view, with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects.” Hawthorne’s decision to use words such as “tumult” and “disorder” causes this passage to stick out from the otherwise orderly ways of Puritan elite. Similarly, the connotation of the word “tribe” is contrary to the civilized Puritan lifestyle.  Here, Hawthorne has consciously decided to depict the Puritans in a wild, uncivilized way in an attempt to present the idea that, although they initially appear sin-free and civilized, deep down they are sinful due to human nature. Here, the Puritans “night gear” and the “nightmare” seen in the faces of the townspeople are used as a symbol for their sin. Although they appear as sinless “personages” in the public view, in reality, they are sinners like everyone else. All people must battle with sin and, even though it is disagreeable to civilized society, it is part of all of us due to the nature of being human. In the chapter, “The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter,” Hawthorne uses the community’s sympathy for Dimmesdale to illustrate how people will sympathize with remorseful wrongdoers even though they have transgressed society’s laws. This is one of the final chapters of the novel, in which Dimmesdale confesses his crimes to his community on the same scaffold that he climbed in “The Minister’s Vigil.” Hawthorne writes: “Mr. Dimmesdale turned to … his brethren … whose great heart was thoroughly appalled, yet overflowing with tearful sympathy, as knowing that some deep life-matter - which, if full of sin, was full of anguish and repentance likewise - was now to be laid open to them. The sun, but little past its meridian, shone down upon the clergyman … as he stood .. to put his plea of guilty at the bar of Eternal Justice.” Here, Hawthorne clearly states the feelings of the community. Although they are appalled by the crimes that Dimmesdale has committed, but still feel sympathy for him. Hawthorne’s description of Dimmesdale’s adultery as a “deep-life matter” explains the reason for their sympathy. Although at first glance the words “deep-life” mean that the crime was of major significance to Dimmesdale, a second look provides a second meaning. The reason for Dimmesdale’s crime was partially due to his decision to commit adultery, but also due to the fact that it is human nature to sin. This is further supported by the fact that the sun was “but little past its meridian” during Dimmesdale’s confession. Here, Hawthorne is referencing the chapter “The Minister’s Vigil” where Dimmesdale promises to only stand on the scaffold with Pearl and Hester at judgement day. After his promise, the sky became bright and , as written on page 145, “they stood in the noon of that strange and solemn splendor” causing Dimmesdale’s promise to be broken. Hawthorne uses this event to support the idea that Dimmesdale is not fully in control of his sins as he is controlled by nature. Because of this lack of control, the Puritan community feels sympathy for Dimmesdale. In their eyes, Dimmesdale’s emotional suffering was not justified. As he is not fully responsible for his actions, he cannot be held fully accountable for his crimes.
7/6/2020 15:46:42	The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) was a militant rebel army, known for its extreme ideologies and brutal tactics, that was the instigator of a bloody civil war throughout Uganda for decades. It was the cause of thousands of civilian deaths and committed countless violations of human rights including massacres, abduction, mutilation, and forcing children to participate in armed, hostile conflicts, causing Africans throughout Uganda and the surrounding regions to live in perpetual fear, negatively impacting their lifestyle. The LRA originated in northern Uganda in the late 1980s after a period of intense unrest and civil war throughout the country. In 1980, Milton Obote, a guerilla ruler, was returned to power. Obote’s regime was one of violence and death; the CIA’s World Factbook approximates that Obote and his regime caused more than 100,000 civilian deaths. As a result, Yoweri Museveni, a revolutionary from southern Uganda, successfully staged a coup, ending the military regime violently and suddenly (Jurgensen). This change in leadership, however, was not as widely supported as one would expect: although Obote’s reign was one of violence, his government was dominated by the Acholi, the largest ethnic group in northern Uganda. As a result, Museveni’s southern heritage and guerilla tactics sparked outrage and protests from groups of northerners who feared they would be economically and politically marginalized by the new southern leader (Hemmer). Between 1986 and 1989 several rebel groups and protest movements began to challenge this new leadership, starting a civil war. The LRA, led by a self-proclaimed spirit medium named Joseph Kony, was born out of these protests, and served as a uniting force for these rebels (Frencken).  The LRA’s actual goals were often unclear throughout their existence. Despite initially forming for political reasons, the LRA sometimes claimed to be religious in nature: its self-proclaimed objective seemed to alternate between the defence of the oppressed citizens of northern Uganda and a divine mission to overthrow Museveni and rule Uganda by the rules of the Biblical Ten Commandments (Hemmer). Despite its hazy and unclear ultimate objective, the LRA became highly organized and opportunistic under the leadership of Joseph Kony. It utilized typical guerilla warfare tactics to gain momentum, attacking villages and civilians whenever it was most opportunistic, which often meant attacks came without warning (Hemmer). These surprise attacks forced civilians to live in perpetual fear, since they could never be certain of when an attack might occur. They gained more power by abducting children from these villages, ultimately reaching a staggering 3,000 soldiers at the peak of their power, and abducting a total of around 75,000 people (Pham). The civilians’ fear and the addition of child soldiers to their ranks helped to cement the LRA’s power. Occasionally, the LRA would also undertake large scale attacks that often resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people to ensure the government’s instability. On top of this, the LRA quickly became known for its brutal methods and for committing grave human rights violations. They abducted children from their homes and forced them to join their movement, massacred thousands of women and children, and displaced large masses of people from their homes. These war crimes and the death of civilians prompted the Ugandan government to begin major military operations against the LRA. It began Operation North, a military operation focused on defeating Kony and his forces, but it ultimately proved to be largely ineffective. The LRA was able to cross into southern Sudan in 1993, and the government there began supporting the LRA soon afterward by providing them with a base for their operations. Further military action became difficult for the Ugandan government to pursue for nearly a decade since the LRA was no longer within their territory, despite the LRA’s ongoing attacks against civilians. In 2002, however, the Sudan government gave the Ugandan armies permission to pursue the LRA into Sudan. This caused the Ugandan government to launch Operation Iron Fist, whose goal was to capture Joseph Kony and his four lead commanders. The operation ultimately failed. In 2005, the International Criminal Court issued warrants for Kony and his commanders.The LRA also repeatedly demonstrated their unwillingness to cooperate or pursue peace, which only raised tensions further. The two sides finally managed to sign a truce agreement in August of 2006, but the peace agreement, although promising at first, proved entirely ineffective: both sides soon broke their side of the agreement and a brief period of deadly conflicts ensued (“Ugandan Cease-Fire Talks”; Hemmer). Peace negotiations, although tense, managed to continue and ultimately the Final Peace Agreement was drafted in 2008. Kony, however, refused to show up to the signing of the agreement three consecutive times, and fighting reignited again. This refusal of Kony to cooperate resulted in countless more lives lost. The issue was finally brought into the international spotlight by a documentary video released on Youtube called Kony 2012. The video attempted to take advantage of society’s growing reliance on social media to draw attention to the conflict in Uganda that, up until then, had been mostly unacknowledged by the rest of the world. It provided more details and footage of the conditions that civilians were forced to undergo as a result of the LRA’s violence, depicting large groups of children living and sleeping in warehouses out of fear that they would be kidnapped while they slept if they returned to their town. An estimated 40,000 of these children would often walk miles each evening from their village to get to these warehouses (Stevens). The video gained instant viral notoriety, inspiring a movement of thousands in the United States. Soon afterward, a bill providing economic and military aid to the Ugandan government in capturing Joseph Kony was signed by President Obama. This financial and military support, as well as the international attention the LRA received, ultimately helped contribute to the decline of the movement and in 2017 the United States and Ugandan forces ended their search for Kony, who had only a small group of supporters left, claiming he was no longer a threat. When confronted with the sheer violence the LRA has committed, one must conclude that they forced Ugandans to live in constant fear for their lives and freedom, and ultimately were powerful enough that they impacted their way of life. The human rights violations they have committed throughout the entirety of their existence are overwhelming: at the height of the conflict an estimated 1.8 million people may have been forced to abandon their homes and tens of thousands killed (Hemmer). Attacks by the LRA often occurred with no warning, which forced the civilians in Uganda to adopt an attitude of constant caution and paranoia. The effects of these attacks were worsened by the government’s apparent inability to protect their citizens, as shown by the failure of multiple military operations and the countless coordinated massacres the LRA was able to execute, such as the Christmas Massacres of 2008 which resulted in an estimated 1,000 civilian casualties, the Makombo Massacre of 2009 in which the LRA murdered 321 innocent civilians, or the abduction of hundreds of students from the Akobe Girl’s School (Frencken). The people’s loss of trust in the government only made the country more unstable.The constant abduction of children was on nearly as large of a scale as the massacres, and forced the youth of the country to spend their childhood in captivity or in constant fear that they might be abducted from their homes, which often provoked them to refuse to go to school. Ultimately, the terrorism and violence Joseph Kony and the LRA created, as well as the grave human rights violations they committed, resulted in widespread fear throughout Uganda and impacted the lives of its citizens negatively by forcing them to live with the suspicion that the LRA could attack at any moment, flee their homes, and prevent children from gaining an education.						
7/6/2020 16:18:46	In The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Reverend Dimmesdale was a part of the adultery committed by Hester Prynne, and has felt a variety of emotions since, mostly consisting of guilt and emptiness. The statement about his confusion with life, “The only truth, that continued to give Mr. Dimmesdale a real existence on this earth was the anguish in his inmost soul, and the undissembled expression of it in his aspect” (142), can best explain how he is feeling lost and conflicted about how his religious and respected self could have committed such an action.This specific guilt led him to do various harmful acts, one of which could have a direct correlation to the mysterious chest pains he has been having. Hawthorne describes how Dimmesdale strays from the typical Puritan practices to punish himself throughout all of Chapter 11, showing that he does engage in various forms of self-abuse to repent for sins. There also might be a connection to the location of the pain, with regards to the fact that Hester Prynne, the source of his guilt, does indeed have a scarlet letter on her chest constantly. When in private, the reverend exclaimed to Hester, “Woman, woman, thou art accountable for this! I cannot forgive thee” (191). He is blaming his suffering and guilt on her, even though the adultery was committed with mutual consent, which obviously tells the reader that his guilt has a direct relation to Hester. Pearl has also figured this out and while questioning her mother about the letter she asks, “What does the letter mean, Mother? And why dost thou wear it? And why does the Minister keep his hand over his heart?” (177). This excerpt from Chapter 15 really stood out to me because Pearl, who has always been surprisingly accurate and observant in her remarks to her mother, was also able to notice a pattern in Hester’s mark on her chest and the often occurrence where the Minister puts his hand on his heart also. A third reasoning to support the correlation between Dimmesdale’s chest pains and his guilt from what he did with Hester is Chillingsworth’s reaction to when he sees what is on his chest: But with what a wild look of wonder, joy, and horror! With what a ghastly rapture, as it were, too mighty to be expressed only by the eye and features, and therefore bursting forth through the whole ugliness of his figure, and making itself even riotously manifest by the extravagant gestures with which he threw up his arms towards the ceiling, and stamped his foot upon the floor! (135). From his reaction, I can conclude that as Hester’s husband, he is so overjoyed and delighted because he now has a target or guess for who the man is that got Hester Prynne pregnant, so when Hawthorne compares Roger Chillingsworth to Satan after seeing what is actually causing the chest pains, I was able to gather that he feels so evil and satanic because he finally found the culprit he had been looking for. From the exclamations of the prodigious and extremely observant Pearl to the reaction of Chillingsworth when finding out what caused the pains on Dimmesdale’s chest, I was able to see how his guilt from the adultery did have an effect on the chest pain. One could also guess that it is a sort of mark or beating to further his existing punishments because of the intense sin that infringed upon all his other emotions.	In the historical fiction novel, The Scarlet Letter, written by American novelist, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Hester Prynne was given a lifetime punishment for her crime of adultery which forced her to wear the letter A among her bosom everywhere and all the time. However nowhere in her punishment does it bind her to stay in the Massachusetts colony to carry this out. Why doesn’t she decide to flee and return home or to another obscure location where her punishment would not be enforced? When I reached Chapter 5 of this story, I was extremely puzzled by this question, and proceeded to put myself in her shoes to attempt figuring out why anybody in their right mind would endure the humiliation she is enduring or suffer through the pain she bears. “What she compelled herself to believe—what, finally, she reasoned upon as her motive for continuing a resident of New England—was half a truth, and half a self-delusion” (77), and it could be guessed that the truth is love and self-delusion is guilt. Love is a powerful force, and it can drive people to do unorthodox things. Although Hester “felt no love, nor feigned any” (72) to her husband, Chillingworth, the audience is left to wonder whether she loved the man who fathered Pearl or if she only cheated out of simple carelessness. One primary reason she decided to stay was because in the New England area, “ there trode the feet of one with whom she deemed herself connected in a union” (77), supporting the assumption that she has deep feelings and connections with this mystery man. Nonetheless, the Puritanical values that were extremely prevalent in seventeenth century Boston prioritize morals and the reach of salvation over all else in life, including romance and lust. Throughout the entirety of Chapters 1 through 9, the theme of punishment for sin has been the lifeline of the plot, which also correlates to the extensive references to their religious beliefs as Puritans. Salvation being the main goal for everyone, Hester Prynne is drawn to stay to repent for her sins and to carry out the punishment because she feels that she deserves it. “Her sin, her ignominy, were the roots which she had struck into the soil” (76-77), and she felt required to stay in the same grounds of which she was given the punishment because the importance of religion to the New England Puritans would trump love anyday. However, Hawthorne does introduce a very interesting new idea, not relating to religion or love at all, as to why Prynne feels so obligated to stay: But there is a fatality, a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom, which almost invariably compels human beings to linger around and haunt, ghost-like, the spot where some great and marked event has given the color to their lifetime; and still the more irresistibly, the darker the tinge that saddens it. (76) This excerpt was extremely catchy idea, that she felt drawn to this area inexplicably because the location where Hester Prynne’s life was completely changed is the location where she must remain while the effects still continue on. It is also captivating because it introduces a notion of spirits and the supernatural, and with the context that Hawthorne was born in Salem, the location of the witch trials, which is a totally new idea to why Prynne would want to stay in Boston.Although love has always been the cause for many unexpected things, religion is another factor that must be considered when considering the historical context of the Puritans in New England, and factoring in the author’s background in Salem, the supernatural forces of evil and guilt from spirits could be a very possible reason also.	After returning to stay with Widow Douglas, civilization through methods of reform were imposed upon thirteen year old Huckleberry Finn who was adjusted to a contrary world with little education or knowledge of manners. While still new to this lifestyle, Huck found himself constantly disagreeing with these religious ideals such as studying in dead people when “[he] was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock in dead people” (2). From his accounted experiences with regards to Widow Douglas and Miss Watson, it seems clear that while he will not express his dissent to be polite, Huck Finn had his issues with grunting before eating and the boring concept of heaven. However, after living with these influential women for a few months, the boy decided to try schooling out to show some respect for these new customs and way of life. With his innate positive attitude towards learning, he was able to succeed in a confining society where he originally thought the religion was nonsense. In fact, “at first [he] hated school, but by and by [he] got so [he] could stand it… So the longer [he] went to school the easier it got to be” (15). This adaptation and acceptance of civilized education shows Huck Finn’s progress from a disapproving, unrefined character who silently passes judgement to a smart kid who has learned a lot from his new school and family. Instead of feeling forced to conform to Widow Douglass and Miss Watson, he actually shows his adept intellect when finding and immediately reading historical texts from a shipwreck to his companion Jim in the scene where “[Jim] was the most down on Solomon of any slave [he] ever see. So [he] went to talking about other kinds, and let Solomon slide” (78). Instead of resting or going through the other trinkets from the wreck, Huck chose the novels about kings, truly showing how his character has changed to choose literature instead of being obligated to learn as in Chapter 1.	F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby acts as a satirical novel through many different criticisms of people who seem to symbolize a certain social stereotype. However, Jay Gatsby’s Jewish business partner stood out as he received the first characterization that included a religion. Following this description, the reader is given a set of disreputable traits to associate people of this religion with. This can attribute to why Fitzgerald specified any religious beliefs in the first place; he wanted to portray the Jewish man as separate from the other non-suspicious characters. The most astonishing description of Meyer that likely piqued the interest of any reader was the cufflinks made from the “finest specimens of human molars” (72). By showing that this character chose to wear a body part to a casual lunch, it depicts a personality of ruthlessness and apathy since cannibalism is typically looked down upon as despicable. Here, there is a possibility that the author is trying to draw attention to how the one Jewish man has a more clouded and inhumane mindset than the rest of the characters. Aside from this merciless portrayal, the cufflinks could also have come across as a threat to Nick, as they could have belonged to a person who tried to wrong Wolfsheim and consequently received the punishment that Meyer thought appropriate. Following the World War I Nazi theme, it only makes sense that Fitzgerald must continue his satire by reinforcing the popular early-1900s notion of Anti-Semitism by making this Jewish character seem the most cruel through their fashion statements and activities. It is revealed that this character is also a gambler and a man who fixed the World Series of 1919 (73), showing that Meyer Wolfsheim not only participated in a risky and typically suspicious activity but somehow also had the power to influence a national championship of America’s most loved sport at the time. Gatsby then mentions that he is too smart to go to jail as a consequence for his actions, showing that he has mastered how to get away with illegal acts.This luncheon also swayed Nick’s view of Gatsby to be more suspicious than it already was. As a reader, the description that Meyer Wolfsheim was wearing human molar cufflinks could spring one to jump from a surface level of appearance down deeper into further analysis about how the only Jewish man in the novel, who coincidentally seems to be the most harsh, corrupted the most relevant character to be involved in the shady business also. Since Jay and Meyer were conversing about business with a man named Katspaugh when Nick arrived and Meyer asked if Nick was looking for a business gonnegtion, it can be clearly assumed that Gatsby has some sort of business involving the skeptical Meyer Wolfsheim, which possibly could include crime or bootlegging. As a result, the narrator may have subconsciously registered him as a root of corruption and shady behavior which is seen as a common description of Gatsby following this interaction. For instance, when Gatsby explained that it took three years to save up for the house, Nick realized that “he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered … before he realized that it wasn’t an appropriate reply” (90). 	This morning felt different; the air was crisper and the temperature had dropped a little. I walked outside and saw that the leaves were starting to fall and rejoiced to myself that summer is finally coming to an end. The whole summer was full of sweltering heat, toiling in rich people’s backyards, however, when I got rehired to work in the Gatsby residence backyard, the dynamic changed. I no longer worked for random elite white couples, I was working for a man that was so unique I almost wish the summer had lasted a little longer. I was so curious about this man after the previous staff that were on their way out told me and the rest of the new staff about his affair with this girl, and I am making it my mission to find out what this is all about. Yesterday was “broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer” (114). You would’ve thought that this meant a last splash of fun and party behavior, however I have never witnessed more tension and agony. This man did not come home until 4am today, and my guess is he was coming from West Egg, possibly from that girl of his, what was her name? Daisy? Maybe he was at her house to try and win her over and had to stay until 4am until he just gave up. It makes sense though; if this lonely man spends years pining for a girl, it will be hard not to hold on to her and accept she’s not coming back. Nonetheless, it’s fall now and I thought all that would be over and he needs to get over her and move on with his life. He gave it a shot and she stayed with her husband so he should respect her decision! Whatever happens is what happens and it should stay in the past, especially the affairs, right? It’s fall and I needed to drain the pool because “leaves’ll start falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes” (153). I was surprised when he told me to keep the pool open for a day. If he hasn’t used it all summer, why start now? Is it possible he is regretting not using it? Maybe he still has hope about his girl and is super elated today, putting him in a summer swimming mood. Although, I couldn’t help but notice a trend here. The man needs to learn how to let go of things. Sometimes seasons change and sometimes you don’t get the girl. Things like this are inevitable and trying to hold onto them puts your whole life on hold, which is why I see him as the lonely man who refused to have a life that wasn’t built around pleasing her. Yesterday was summer and everyone seemed hot and bothered, just as I presume the lonely man felt when he lost the girl. However, it is fall now and he is just stalling. Maybe I could go talk to him and tell him that no matter how long he stalls, fall is coming eventually. I almost feel bad now and I am really realizing a lot about him. The lonely man is just desperate for love and he has been wanting his girl for so long. He seems like the type of man to stay in the denial stage in the five stages of grief and it seems as though he might even die before he could reach the stage of acceptance. It is autumn now and the leaves are ready to fall from the trees just as lonely man should be ready to close the pool. Instead, he is clinging on to the very last remnants of the summer in which he had hoped that he would get the girl but we have already passed the climax of this love story. How can I get this poor lonely man to understand that it’s time for the resolution, there is no more up from here! Yes, yesterday was still summer, a time for dreams. However, today is fall and we need to come to terms with reality. Seasons change and people do too, but wrapping your head around the concept that someone might move on without you is something this lonely man clearly cannot achieve.	Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter was set in the seventeenth century Massachusetts Bay Colony which upheld the confining values of a Puritan lifestyle. Laws were made based off religion, and the church and the state were very intertwined. All people were expected to be Calvinists who took their relationship with God seriously, leading to little tolerance for any misbehaving, from a religious or political aspect.In this novel, it was a religious belief that adultery was an intolerable act that required severe punishment. Since the government and church were not separated, laws and officials could act on this to create a life of suffering for anyone involved in the ‘crime’. Hester Prynne was forced into a life of humiliation and isolation and Reverend Dimmesdale endured guilt and self-inflicted pain throughout the whole novel proving as examples of the punishment of the wrong-doers. On the other hand, the controversial child Pearl did nothing to deserve any embarrassment but still had to live her childhood receiving a substantial second-hand amount of it. For example, when Hester and Pearl were going to meet with the Governor to discuss the custody of the child, the townspeople threw mud at them and shamed them. This is one case out of many where the innocent girl encountered a shameful life just because of her mother rather than her own actions. Not only did she live a life of isolation and humiliation, Pearl was also deprived of a proper family. Since Dimmesdale is in a valued position, he would not be considered with the same respect if his identity as the father is revealed. However, Pearl rejects this denial by refusing to accept any kisses from him unless they are in public. In the same scene in the forest, she gets upset when Hester takes off her letter because Pearl is the embodiment of the letter and without the letter, it would seem as if the girl is less important to Hester. Both of these examples show how she likes stability, either through a family with both a mother and a father or through a mom who will always literally and figuratively keep Pearl close to her heart. One might agree that Pearl’s life was ruined because of this isolation and depravity of friends and a solid family, but another could argue back that she actually benefited from this situation. Because none of the children wanted to be friends with her, she found happiness elsewhere with her ability to make anything around her in nature  into a character her fantasy stories. Her imagination soared and she was able to be content regardless of the other children with her make-believe friends. She also was not bounded by society to act in certain ways since everyone already thought she was a demon child, so this counter-argument raises the paradox that her lack of freedom in society actually created more creativity and personal independence than any other child could even imagine. Nonetheless, Hawthorne set up his plot to depict how the suffocatingly strict Puritan religious values influenced the political action taken upon Hester to ban her from society and to elaborate on how everyone else involved in the situation suffered too. The only reason for this suffering is because the religious values were acted upon in a political manner, and if the church and state were actually separate, the worst that might have happened is excommunication from the Church, but not an exile from society. Therefore, the author does a fantastic job at making the consequences of no church-state separation so evident throughout the story. Ever since the Declaration of Independence, Americans have lived in a society where our government does not discriminate based off one set of religious beliefs, and by referencing to what can happen with no church-state separation through Hawthorne’s criticism of religion as an institution, we can hold The Scarlet Letter as essential to American literature because it highlights and values our fundamental pillar of freedom.	What defines an essential text of American literature? The answer is unclear; it could mean a story that depicts a specific aspect of life that would otherwise be neglected in historical texts or it could mean a story with a valuable moral and life lesson engraved throughout the plot. I believe a story’s essentiality can be most judged by what it gives back to the reader once fully understood and if the text is looked at closely enough, Pinckney Benedict’s short story, “Town Smokes”, can be extremely informative regarding the lifestyle depicted throughout the narrative. The narrator of this story is a fifteen-year-old boy who lives in a small timber community in the West Virginia mountains with his father and uncle. Benedict was able to paint the perfect picture of small town life and all the emotions and considerations of someone living it. The boy’s house was close to a town nearby, but he never visited it. He was so close to achieving bigger things in life but was tied down by only one thing, his father. As a result of this, the only influence on his life was his father and the radio that his uncle listened to so often every evening. It can also be inferred that he never really had parents who took care of him and tended to his every need like a helicopter parents would, resulting in his high level or maturity at the plain age of fifteen. For example, on the day that his dad died, the boy went up to his uncle conversing about going into town to get some cigarettes and Hunter, the uncle, did not think it was typical for someone of his age to want to engage in activities that adults usually do. The effects of his isolation from lots of people with different gender, opinions, and social classes have clearly shown in his maturity and limited opinions depicted with the frequent use of the word ‘mebbe’. Since his dad was the only thing keeping him settled in his simple mountain life, once he was freed from that, he immediately decided to go into town because he does not just want the normal cigarettes, he wants the town smokes. This isolation and depravity of the ‘big city’ concept that was a prevalent theme throughout the whole story could also be representative of small town boys all around America, which is why it is important that this text was able to give the reader valuable information by diving deep into this specific lifestyle which would have been otherwise ignored. Nevertheless, I do believe that essential texts should be able to give the reader more than just historical context and a background of American small town life, but if a text can claim itself essential, it needs to have an impact on the reader so they can gather a powerful lesson. “Town Smokes” describes the day when the narrator's dad dies and there is a perpetual talk of rain throughout the entire plot. At the beginning of the story, he acknowledges the rain and says he just sees the sky and blue and clear, however after the entire day progresses, in the last page he describes the rain as hitting different than it did in the morning; it was not as calm. This description of the rain and his statement about how he will never return to his home at the mountain after reaching town were the only two things used to give the reader any sort of closure or value to the story. We are able to gather that his death denial has worn off over the course of the day and that after experiencing life in the town, he will never look back, however the ending could be interpreted in a multitude of ways that could either leave the reader confused and left on a cliffhanger or hopeful that the boy will do bigger things with his life. However, the conclusion tended to leave people with scattered emotions, even after continual analysis of the text. There are many ways one could argue that Benedict’s story is essential and I would most likely agree with them because it positively contributed to American literature with a description of West Virginia mountain lifestyle, which is impressive due to the short amount of text in this story, however it is only essential to a certain extent because of its lack of value and meaning and easily misinterpreted closure at the end of the story.
7/6/2020 17:36:32	Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter is taught in every high school in America as a highly insightful work of social criticism. Teachers believe that the novel illuminates themes relevant not just to the young America, but to all of us today. But although The Scarlet Letter’s exploration of social stigma and individuality in young America provides an interesting discussion framework for students of American Literature, The Scarlet Letter is to no extent an essential American text; its outdated premise, even more than its uncompelling characters, impenetrable prose, and nonexistent plot, render the novel irrelevant and undistinguished to modern readers. That The Scarlet Letter is a tale of four people tangled in a sin is not in itself disqualifying. But the premise of The Scarlet Letter is an act of adultery—an underwhelming “crime” by modern standards. Hester’s ostracisation and Dimmesdale’s seven-year personal torment seem ridiculous when considered in the context of their actions. This creates a disconnect between the author and the reader, a disconnect created by cultural shifts and the passing of time that no prosaic drama (or, in the eyes of the modern student, melodrama) can bridge. Thus, The Scarlet Letter fails to justify itself to today’s audiences; and no story which fails this basic task can be considered essential. In point of fact, the text is a failure not just in premise, but in execution too. If pressed, I doubt most American Literature students, even those who have faithfully read and discussed the book, could produce a plot summary, or a single character they find compelling. This is because, fundamentally, The Scarlet Letter deals in archetypes, not human beings. Each character may as well be a robot, performing its designated function: Hester dutifully accepts the stigma placed on her by the community, Dimmesdale dutifully performs the functions of his office while feeling internally guilty, and so on. None of these characters relate to modern audiences because not once, in seven years, do any of them falter. This inhuman dance of characters is yet another reason why the novel is irrelevant to American Literature students today. But doesn’t the novel’s portrayal of shame and social stigma strike a chord with readers even today? Yes and no. Public shame is a cultural constant—from public scaffolding to the modern #MeToo movement, shame is one of our most powerful tools to hold others accountable for their actions. But The Scarlet Letter’s discussion of stigma in the Puritan era is fundamentally not how we approach controversy anymore. The rigid morality and traditional power structure portrayed in the novel, which produced the scarlet letter in question, has all but disintegrated. For better or for worse, modern technology has allowed for exponential growth in our discussion of public shame, allowing millions of diverse individuals to assert their views on the actions of a single person. There is no such thing as social consensus anymore—but social consensus is what the novel relies on. This again renders The Scarlet Letter all but useless to Americans today. The Scarlet Letter, while in theory an interesting portrayal of guilt, shame, and social stigma in young America, is in reality a dull and uncompelling text. Its most compelling themes can be found in much more relatable, relevant, and readable texts than this outdated novel.	The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is, at heart, a novel about the immorality of slavery, but its usage of death seems more absurdist than abolitionist: only seven chapters in, Huck fakes his own murder with almost laughable lightheartedness. But while Huck’s casual relationship with death seems more a product of carelessness than of understanding, in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, death actually holds great significance to Huck by representing freedom; Huck learns about the immorality of the South and its institution of slavery through its disrespect of the dead, like himself, Boggs, and Peter Wilkes, each of whom represent a free man in their own ways. By faking his own death, Huck secures his freedom from his exploitive father, but he is also unwittingly exposed to the true face of the South. After finding the scene of his supposed butchering, the townspeople’s first instinct isn’t to mourn his death; rather, it’s to insist on locating him as quickly as possible, as if he poses a danger to the townspeople of the South. Huck’s freedom, in this case, is analogous to that of escaped slaves like Jim, save for one crucial difference: Huck’ “death” is permanent, and the idea of permanent freedom is unacceptable. So Huck, hidden in a bush, watching the search party sail by gossiping about his murder, is exposed to the tyranny of the South: slavery binds all—black, white, free, enslaved, living, dead—to its cruelty. Meanwhile, in the case of Boggs, we find a man chained to alcohol; from him, Huck reinforces the connection between freedom, death, and slavery. Boggs, as we learn from the loafers of his town, is “the best-naturedest old fool in Arkansaw—never hurt nobody...”. Yet, after he’s gunned down by Colonel Sherburn, the townspeople reenact his shooting, rewarding the would-be actors with drinks. The disrespect with which they treat Boggs—serving alcohol to commemorate the death of a man killed by his alcoholism!—strengthen this piece of Huck’s moral education: that dependence on slavery reinforces itself through the degradation of those whom death has freed from it. Peter Wilkes, on the other hand, found himself tied not to alcohol, but to money; however, his situation mirrors that of the tragic Boggs. The struggle for possession of his estate consumed not just his family but his entire town; in fact, the only individual free from involvement in the brawl was Peter Wilks himself. And yet it’s his peace that is most disturbed by it, when the townspeople swarm the cemetery, dig up his grave, and plunder his coffin. To Huck, evident in Wilks’s situation is the disregard of Southerners for the dead, the free—those who, by virtue of their situation, are no longer bound to the institution of slavery, an unthinkable prospect. Overall, the treatment of death in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn serves as a powerful symbol for the treatment of freedom from slavery: slavery, like death, is universal to Southerners. For how can the poisonous vine of slavery survive without digging its roots in every Southern citizen, white or black? What Huck unwittingly learns here is that because of slavery’s chokehold on the South, the possibility of freedom, even through death, is meaningless short of nothing but slavery’s abolition. 	Nineteenth-century Edinburgh, Scotland presented a fascinating look into the dualities that can coexist within a city. The elite elements of the city often were the very same disgraceful elements that threatened its reputation, and nowhere is this better illustrated than in Robert Louis Stevenson’s 1886 novel The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, which presents a duality in the form of the two contradictory and yet interdependent personalities Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The novel, though written in Bournemouth and set in London, is truly representative of the duality of Victorian Scottish people and culture, focusing on Stevenson’s own home city of Edinburgh. Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is one of the most famous examples of duality in literature: Dr Jekyll, a respectable, well-liked doctor, physically transforms into a different man when his evil, indulgent alter ego, Mr Hyde, appears. Stevenson is purposefully presenting his own belief in the duality of human nature, going so far as to spell it out for us when he states, though Dr Jekyll, that “...man is not truly one, but truly two (Stevenson 84).” There is no doubt that his methodical description of Jekyll and Hyde’s differences is meant to illustrate the clear split between the good doctor’s outer persona and the hidden struggles that characterise his worst impulses in the form of Mr Hyde. Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, Stevenson’s home city, we observe the same divide. In the Victorian Era especially, the city was well-known for its split personality: wealthy gentlemen dallied with opium dens, burgesses visited brothels, and at night, the most respectable of citizens could be found at the lowliest of gambling houses. As Scottish literary historian David Daiches observes, “The fascination of the double self, so much part of the fabric of Edinburgh life, left a lasting impression on [Stevenson]. There was sufficient evidence to serve his purpose and to fire his imagination. Major Weir, the strict Covenanting soldier who was found to be a wizard; Deacon Brodie, respectable citizen by day, robber by night; Burke and Hare the body-snatchers with their resurrectionist confederate Dr Robert Knox; and Hogg's hall of mirrors and deception, the novel of demonic possession, The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner. All these were grist to the future writer's mill (59).” Clearly, the theme of the double self is based at least in part off of the city of Edinburgh: “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is in a rich literary tradition of books about doubles...but it also comes from, and is in large part about, his own Scottish background: Louis had had first-hand experience of Victorian hypocrisy in Edinburgh; he had grown up in a divided city; he had often stepped out of the respectable New Town into the disinhibited, amoral semi-underworld of the Old...He understood the emblematic nature of...his own city, and he knew how Calvinism divided the world into the elect and the damned (Bell 191).” Even Edinburgh’s geography is indicative of the dichotomy: Scottish journalist Allan Massie asks, “Is Edinburgh chilly or welcoming? Friendly or exclusive? Secretive or open? I confess that, after long acquaintance with the place...I don't know the answer to these questions. There is a duality to Edinburgh…The city which inspired Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, even if Robert Louis Stevenson chose to set that very Edinburgh story in London (1).” Massie is referring to the striking difference between Edinburgh’s New and Old Towns. The city’s New Town, constructed between 1767 and 1850, displays wide, sweeping streets, elegant gardens, and statuesque Georgian architecture—in short, the town characterises cultured upper-class living. Meanwhile, the 12-century Old Town is a dark, grimy labyrinth of twisting cobblestone wynds and secretive alleyways; in the words of David Whitley, it poses “a rather better match for [Dr Jekyll’s] altar ego, Mr Hyde (3).” We can also see Edinburgh’s dichotomy present in Stevenson’s minor characters—for instance, in the doctor summoned to treat the distraught young girl trampled by Hyde: ”He was the usual cut-and-dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent, and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us: every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him (Stevenson 11).” This respectable Scottish doctor is something like Dr Jekyll: he represents the intellectual, respectable Scotland. However, he turns sick and uncomfortable at the sight of Mr. Hyde, who represents the nefarious, disgraceful Scotland—thus illustrating how loath the “face” of Scotland, Dr. Jekyll, if you will, is to seeing Mr. Hyde, its grimy underworld, shamelessly exposed for all to see. Scotland’s Victorian culture exhibited this same split personality, widely recognised but never voiced. In the words of Scottish historian Christopher Harvie, “...If anything characterized post-Union (or for that matter post-Reformation) Scottish culture it was its essentially schizoid quality. The ‘red’ Dr Jekyll part of the intelligentsia— Hume, Carlyle, Geddes, Reith—was cosmopolitan, self-avowedly ‘enlightened,’ and, given a chance, authoritarian, expanding into and exploiting greater and more bountiful fields than their own country could provide. Back home, in his kailyard, lurked Hyde, demotic, parochial and ‘black’ reactionary, keeper of Tom Nairn’s ‘great Tartan monster,’ reader of the Sunday Post. ‘Red’ and ‘black’ Scotland depended on each other: Jekyll remitted money and prestige; Hyde kept the place distinctive, ensured that the ladder of social promotion was kept open, that the social stratification of the English governing classes was not imposed.” Here, we see that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, while antithetical, are also codependent—without the release of Hyde, Jekyll could never survive, whereas the reputation of Hyde would be unsalvageable without the upright Jekyll. As Hana Layson and Jules Law so eloquently phrase it, ”[Jekyll and Hyde] explores what it [would] mean for educated, Victorian men to pursue pleasure free of the inhibiting threat of social ostracism (90).” Clearly, the theme of duality runs strongly throughout both The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Victorian Edinburgh. The multiple personalities that frame Robert Louis Stevenson’s native culture and city are apparent in the narrative of his most famous work.	The first piece of artwork to discuss is an iron Ming Chinese bust of an aged Buddhist monk. The nearby explanatory plaque describes him as an arhat, a “disciple of the Buddha who has attained spiritual realisation and supernatural powers.” The sculptor presents the monk’s mien as involving many elements of Buddhist culture—simple robes, shaved head, calm, stoic demeanor—that are clearly influenced by the ideology of Buddhism itself. Firstly, the monk’s clothes are representative of the core principle of Buddhism: freedom from desire. His robes are simple, comfortable, and utilitarian. There is no vanity in his choice of garment, which fits well with the Buddhist ideal of emancipation from material desire. His shaved head and tranquil countenance also indicate that he feels no attachment to his looks, choosing to remain utilitarian rather than be slave to desire. Another important aspect of the Buddhist ideology is reflected in this monk’s face. We can see that he is meant to represent an arhat (or luohan, the Chinese term for the same concept), a defender of the dharma (the Buddha’s teaching of the nature of reality), because of his aged features. Arhats, who teach the dharma when there is no buddha on earth to teach it, live extraordinarily long lives. As such, they are often represented in artwork as old, gnarled figures, and this statue is no exception. His bushy eyebrows and heavy wrinkles demonstrate his unsurpassed age, illustrating the Buddhist ideology in action. The second piece of artwork to analyse is a small, simple copper Kongolese crucifix crafted in the seventeenth century. The figure of Christ is depicted as an African man in simple dress, arms splayed wide. Again, his bodily features and demeanor exemplify the messages of the Christian doctrine, and the crucifix itself illustrates the one of the most central aspects of Christianity. Firstly, the simple dress of the figure—a single piece of simple cloth tied around the waist—and the thin limbs and sharply defined ribs embody one of Christ’s strongest directives: that all material belongings should go towards benefitting the poor. The Christian ideology involves a message that the followers should not collect wealth, but rather disseminate it to those in need, and the simplicity of this Christ figure’s clothing and features shows that the artist crafted the piece to demonstrate Christ’s lifestyle as an example to others. Next, the very image of the crucifix is central to Christianity. The crucifix is meant to represent a defining moment in the history of its central figure: the sacrifice of Christ for the sins of humanity. From the Christian perspective, Christ’s acceptance of suffering shows that he—and by extension the Christian god—loves humanity enough to endure agony for them and even death for them. It also demonstrates another central Christian value: total obedience to their god. Though Christ does not initially want to die, he willingly does so after god directs him to, again providing an example to his followers of what the Christian ideology entails. This figure was carved with this story in mind to remind Christians of what Jesus Christ represented and what they are to recognise and be grateful for. 	Gregor Samsa, the main character of The Metamorphosis, is a middle-class travelling salesman whose life is utterly unremarkable until that fateful day in which he wakes up as a monstrous insect. His reflections tell us that he is a quiet but sincere individual who does his best to be useful and untroublesome to those around him: “...he fled to the door of his room, and pressed himself against it, so that his father, on stepping in from the hallway, might see right away that Gregor had every intention of going back promptly into his room, and there was no necessity to use force, he had only to open the door for him, and he would disappear through it right away (p. 123-124).” Indeed, he faces his initial transformation with absolute calm, simply doing his best to adapt to his new conditions. His weakness, however, lies in his passivity—his desire to please others and remain unexacting impedes his ability to fight for what he wants or even needs and leads to the alienation of his family. His sister Grete, meanwhile, is a much more dynamic character. She begins the story as a carefree, sweet, and innocent girl, enjoying a close relationship with her brother and playing the violin as a hobby: “...still a child with her seventeen years, and who so deserved to be left in the manner of her life heretofore, which consisted of wearing pretty frocks, sleeping in late, helping out at the pub, taking part in a few modest celebrations and, above all, playing the violin (p. 114).” In truth, she’s the first to spare a thought for Gregor’s needs and quickly becomes his caretaker and sole human contact. Still, she undergoes a metamorphosis of her own over the course of the story, becoming more assertive as she gets a job, takes responsibility for Gregor, and begins to contribute to the family. This metamorphosis, however, is accompanied by a loss of empathy on her part, and she begins to resent her duties as Gregor’s attendant. Eventually, she becomes the first to suggest that Gregor be removed from the house, illustrating her full transformation: “‘Dear parents,’ said his sister, and brought her hand down on the table top to obtain silence, ‘things cannot go on like this. You might not be able to see it, but I do. I don’t want to speak the name of my brother within the hearing of that monster, and so I will merely say: we have to try to get rid of it (p. 138).’” The story ends with her parents’ realisation that she has matured into a beautiful young woman, and that it may be time to start looking for a husband for her. One of the most important decisions in the book is Grete’s resolution to remove the furniture from Gregor’s room. This task is undertaken both as a result of Grete’s impression that Gregor would be happier without it, and their mother’s desire to visit Gregor, which Grete had not previously allowed. Gregor is initially grateful for the decision, but a comment from his mother causes him to become distressed over the removal of his furniture and, taking advantage of a moment in which his mother and sister are not present, he attempts to save one of his most prized possessions. However, they re-enter as he’s hanging on the wall, causing his mother, shocked and repulsed by his appearance, to faint. Gregor, distressed, rushes out of the room, only to run into his father, who is arriving home from work. His father is taken by anger and begins to throw apples at the terrified Gregor, one of which lodges in a sensitive spot and permanently paralyses him (p. 117-126).  This chain of events seems to constitute a turning point in the story: from that point onwards, Gregor is almost completely dehumanised, and sinks into depression. His family, meanwhile, no longer cares for him, only tolerating him in their sadness: “Who in this exhausted and overworked family had the time to pay more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household seemed to shrink…No longer bothering to think what might please Gregor, his sister before going to work in the morning and afternoon now hurriedly shoved some food or other into Gregor’s room with her foot, and in the evening reached in with her broom to hook it back out again, indifferent as to whether it had been only tasted or even—as most regularly happened—had remained quite untouched (p. 128-130).” One major theme of the novel was its societal commentary. When Gregor is introduced to us, he’s just been transformed into a giant cockroach—and yet his first instinct is to express some mild discontent with his job and wonder how he’s going to get to work: “...he looked across at the alarm clock, ticking away on the bedside table. ‘Great heavenly Father!’ he thought...What to do now? The next train left at seven; to catch it meant hurrying like a madman, and his samples weren’t yet packed, and he himself didn’t feel exactly agile or vigorous (p. 89).” Every aspect of Gregor’s life is so bourgeois, and he’s so numbed to living, that he doesn’t feel any surprise or wonder at this incredible and mysterious event—a comment on how middle-class life at the time could become so mundane that eventually, one is completely desensitised, perhaps. I’ve experienced a version of this effect myself (although I’d like to think that I’m not yet numbed to all wonder): certainly, during long stretches of school where we have no breaks or recesses, I start to wonder if there is anything to look forward to. The monotony becomes too much, and I’m left feeling like Gregor—far too caught up in everyday responsibilities and societal expectations to care about fulfillment and purpose in life. (Fortunately, these periods are few and far between, and don’t reflect my general attitude towards life in the slightest.) Another interesting aspect of the book is the Samsas’ unexpected reaction to Gregor’s mutation: the bonds of family that seemingly linked them strongly before are almost immediately broken in their disgusted reactions to Gregor, and they turn their backs on him entirely when times get tough. To me, this raises the question: Is their reaction driven by their revulsion to Gregor, or do they simply stop caring about him because he can no longer provide money? Is this Kafka’s method of commenting on the predilection of society to value only members it sees as fit to work? I’ve also noticed that oftentimes we as a civilisation have that response to those who can’t contribute to the workforce. The homeless, the elderly—these groups of people are often looked down on, and many of us strive to pretend they are not a part of our population so as not to have to help them (consider the common response of avoiding eye contact when a panhandler asks for money). They are considered the “bugs” of our society. This effect in particular, and the overlapping levels of meaning and complexity throughout the piece, speak to the tremendous power of Kafka’s work, and the fact that it can be interpreted in so many different ways shows its incredible dynamism and versatility. 	A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a mini-generator powered by the metabolic outputs of microorganisms. The electrons emitted by the microbes as they consume substrate and respire are used to charge the circuit of the MFC. MFCs have garnered much interest in recent years because of their ability to produce electricity from a variety of substances, including waste products, and provide an effective and low-cost solution to both the problem of wastewater disposal and the issue of generating clean, renewable energy (Rahimnejad, Adhami, Darvari, Zirepour, & Oh, 2015). MFCs are an especially notable source of clean energy  as they do not release gasses which aggravate pollution (Rahimnejad et al., 2015). However, one of the issues facing MFCs is their propensity to clog in the filter, reducing their catalytic efficiency and therefore overall voltage output (Rago et al., 2018; Marzorati, Schievano, Colombo, Lucchini, & Cristiani, 2018). MFCs produce electricity through a unique and ingenious process. The microbial biofilm breaks down the substrate into hydrogen ions and electrons, and those electrons flow into an external circuit where current is generated (Shukla & Kumar, 2018). This entire process is anaerobic, while the other half of the MFC is aerobic. Electrons move from the wire onto the cathode where they react with oxygen and hydrogen ions to form H2O. Additionally, a semipermeable membrane allows movement of hydrogen ions between the two compartments, equalizing the electrochemical gradient (Rahimnejad et al., 2015). Many experiments have focused on constructing these membranes out of low-cost, environmentally-friendly, and porous materials, such as terracotta, rather than standard nafion membranes (Rago et al., 2018; Gajda, Stinchcombe, Greenman, Melhuish, & Ieropoulos, 2015; Winfield, Gajda, Greenman, & Ieropoulos, 2016). This widens the possibility of large-scale practical applications of the MFC, for scientists can inexpensively produce more MFCs to combat the issue of rapid clogging of the membrane (Rago et al., 2018). Aside from providing for effective yet cost-efficient membranes, studies have demonstrated that terracotta yields other special qualities. For instance, because of its porosity, terracotta can recover nutrients and precious metals from wastewaters (Rago et al., 2018). Furthermore, Rago et al. (2018) showed that, although the overall current density was lower for their terracotta-membrane MFC than their biocathode-MFC, the terracotta membrane encouraged the growth of less electroactive microorganisms rather than greatly electroactive ones (Rago et al., 2018). In fact, Winfield, Chambers, Rossiter, and Ieropoulos (2013) demonstrated that ceramic membranes tend to provide more suitable conditions for all electroactive microorganisms than usual cation exchange membranes (CEMs), for the ceramic membrane showed far greater aptitude for resisting acidification. The same study also showed that the ceramic membrane MFC, produced similar levels of voltage as the CEM MFC and maintained equal amounts of long-term stability and greater amounts of short-term stability when compared to the CEM MFC.  Lastly, terracotta, with its captured nutrients, can be reused for farm soil conditioning (Rago et al., 2018), and this is highly favorable in large-scale applications due to the short durations of MFCs. Instead of comparing terracotta to more common membranes such as nafion, a few studies have focused on varying the terracotta membrane’s properties to optimize the MFC’s overall performance. For instance, Winfield, Greenman, Huson, and Ieropoulos (2013) investigated structural variables including membrane thickness, and they found that the MFC with the thickest terracotta membrane produced the most voltage overall. The same study mentions experimenting with a cylindrical design in addition to their single-chambered MFCs to optimize surface area, but this parameter is not specifically analyzed. Thus, we wish to analyze and compare these parameters within our study. The various studies on utilizing terracotta membranes each used varying designs for their MFC. Rago et al. (2018) used single-chamber terracotta-membrane MFCs, whereas Gajda et al. (2015) used a cylindrical design with the anode on the outside, the cathode on the inside, and the terracotta membrane in-between. However, few studies, if any, have paired these specific membranes with a dual-chamber design. Furthermore, Gajda et al. (2015) showed in their study that the catholyte accumulation, which was allowed by the formation of an inner cathode “chamber” from the cylindrical design, improved the performance of the MFC. The catholyte accumulation effect is not achievable with a single-chamber MFC; however, the dual-chamber MFC provides a cathode chamber. Therefore, we will construct our terracotta-membrane MFCs with the dual-chamber design to utilize this novel and potentially advantageous pairing. In this study, we wish to explore the effect of varying the thickness and surface area of terracotta membranes on the performance of the MFC in comparison with a control terracotta-membrane MFC. The null hypothesis is that there will not be any significant differences between the performance of the MFCs. The alternate hypothesis is that the performance of the thick-membrane MFC will exceed that of the larger-surface-area-membrane MFC, whose performance will in turn exceed that of the control MFC. Performance is based on average voltage output. After constructing the MFCs, we will measure the average voltage output from each MFC, and then compare the data against data from the control MFC. 	
7/6/2020 17:46:15	After the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, America was left on its own to flesh out what its values were. There were differing opinions, such as George Washington’s warning that the United States should not have a party system or alliances when others at the time thought the country was too young to be involved in the world. However, one thing that united everyone was the idea that the new country was a place to make your own life the best it could be. As the United States kicked off a new century with its third president being elected, it ushered in a period of strong economic, social, and political developments that both united and tore apart the country, leading to a period of time between 1800 and 1844 that experienced great change that broke down the newly-formed American identity centered around unity. In 1801, Jefferson took the stage as America’s first Democratic-Republican president (Doc 1) and gave an inaugural speech that demonstrated that Americans were all on the same side with the same principles, no matter what party they identified under. This speech about union foreshadowed the later “Era of Good Feelings” that began later in 1812, where nearly Americans identified as Democratic-Republicans, allowing for a period of peace in politics. However, by the time the country inched closer and closer to the Civil War, the country became increasingly more divided. The North saw Lowell Mills popping up, giving way to an industrialized society. Meanwhile, the South further developed their plantation life with slavery and agriculture dominating their lifestyle. This increasing social change in the country caused the divide that led us into the Civil War, showing that the original state of unity that Jefferson had explained in his inaugural speech had crumbled over time. Jefferson acknowledged this sharp change in union in 1820 (4), when he considered that the question of slavery would be the death of the new nation. The nation had undergone an irreversible strong social change that would break apart the union it one valued. While social change divided us, economic change often united us. With the introduction of interstate roads and canals (Doc 2), we saw a more united country, with an interdependent nature. Agriculture in the south supported the textile industry in the north. President Madison explained in his address to congress that a national system of interconnected roads and canals would bind us closer together, and he was right. This economic change brought forth the American identity that valued union at the time, that had not yet made a complete turnaround by 1844 because the states were still united under one interconnected country. However, the interstate system was not enough to resist the other overwhelming changes that occurred from 1800 to 1844. While the country did experience positive economic change with the introduction of interstate travel, the necessity of a national bank was questioned. Its renewal was vetoed by President Andrew in 1832, leading to further breakdown of systems that united the country (5).	After many years of working on establishing itself as a legitimate country, America had finally reached a secure place where it could take time to work out its core values. After the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and numerous other conflicts, Americans were compelled to improve their country. Our nation was founded on the principles of democracy, equality, and independence, yet we had not figured out what those ideals looked like in the real world. In an attempt to revive those principles, the Progressive movement was born. Leaders emerged from many sub-movements, like prohibition and jail reform, and spoke out on the issues that meant most to them. However, this apparent shining moment of American growth wasn’t as efficient as it appeared to be. Although the Progressive movement fostered social and political change in the United States to a major extent between 1890 and 1920, some attempts of reform actually perpetuated pre-existing problems that resisted change. Firstly, it is important to understand the far-reaching efforts of the movements that were led in this era. These impactful movements affected Americans’ day-to-day life, including their interactions with monopolies, alcohol, and the justice system. Furthermore, the leaders that emerged ranged from everyday people to big figures in the federal government. For example, Theodore Roosevelt explained in a speech in Rhode Island during his presidency that it was imperative that the government take action to supervise and regulate the great corporations in the country (2). This was an important issue at the time, as corporations could easily exploit their workers, paying them with dirt-cheap wages and giving them minimal rights. In terms of alcohol, the temperance movement gained significant popularity, especially among women (7). The prohibition leader Carrie Nation thought that the evils of alcohol were manifested in men’s maltreatment of their wives at home. This often led to the argument that alcohol should be eradicated from American society for the sake of quality of family life. Moreover, the justice system was involved in the movement. Leaders fought for the reform of criminals, rather than strict punishment with no chance of improvement. This was especially prominent with juveniles, as discussed by Julian W. Mack in the Harvard Law Review. Leaders of these movements had great depth to their arguments, and promised things like reorganization of the police force (6) and campaigns against voting corruption (1). However, some of these attempts at “movements” actually effectively perpetuated pre-existing problems, like racism against African American people. President Woodrow Wilson passed an act to allow for all-black bureaus to exist, in an attempt to provide equal treatment and less discrimination against black people (5). However, this perpetuated the idea that African American people should be separated, inside of integrated with everyone else. This “reform” attempt was just an attempt to further segregate citizens, and did not allow for a change in the quality of life for African Americans. All in all, while many major impacts were made by the Progressive reform movements between 1890 and 1920, not all movements did enact true change in American life. Attempts in changing the situation around voting corruption, criminal reform, and alcohol abuse were successful and changed American life, while attempts at bettering African American life did not change very much.	In Henry David Thoreau’s work, Walden, he recounts his time in nature and his day-to-day experiences as an individualist. From meditations on solitude to stories of his time in the woods, Thoreau’s writing reveals his opinions on how one must freely live in a society filled with structure. While some readers may interpret Walden as a text that gives readers direct advice on how to live their lives, further analysis shows that Thoreau does not appear to have any intention of telling his readers what to do and instead wrote the text for himself as a method of self-reflection. His intention of self-reflection, rather than advice-giving, is demonstrated in his often wordy, poetic word choice and his lack of direct acknowledgement of his readers. It must be recognized that it can be argued that Thoreau wrote Walden in the form of a “moral handbook,” a style of writing that gives direct advice to readers on what core values they should center their lives around. In the book, Thoreau draws attention to the importance of living a simple life, where little emphasis is placed on materialistic values and societal expectations and more emphasis is placed on self-reliance through his narrative. Simply put, Walden is a how-to guide explaining how Thoreau simplified his life of excess (Wayne). The work follows Thoreau’s journey through his experiment at Walden Pond, where he built a shack in the woods in order to “live deliberately, [and] to front only the essential facts of life” (Thoreau 72). He spent time in solitude in nature, and later published his reflections on his experiment for others to learn from. As literary critic Tiffany K. Wanye writes, “He presented his work publicly… in hopes that the ideas and conclusions he drew there would cure some of the evils of the society he cared about.” Walden suggests to readers to live a life centered around simplicity and nature, as Thoreau did in his experiment. However, although Walden gives advice on how to live a simple and nature-focused life, it does not address its readers directly, therefore it does not follow the “moral handbook” definition.  This lack of explicit advice for the reader is manifested in two ways: difficult language and absence of direct remarks to readers. It is clear that Thoreau did not write Walden with the reader’s ease of understanding in mind. Rather, he wrote it with the goal of self-reflection, allowing him to sort through his own thoughts. This is exemplified in his use of overly-poetic, and at times, confusing, language. In the chapter “Solitude” in Walden, he writes, “This whole earth which we inhabit is but a point in space. How far apart, think you, dwell the two most distant inhabitants of yonder star, the breadth of whose disk cannot be appreciated by our instruments?” (Thoreau 106). This wording, which uses a poetic tone, forces readers to slow down to understand the rhythm that Thoreau intended for the passage to be read in. For the general audience, poetic language like this may be confusing if read too quickly.  From this, we can infer that Thoreau did not have his audience’s enjoyment and ease of reading in mind. This poetic tone gives the impression that Thoreau documented his ideas and experiences in the way that made sense to him, rather than in a way that speaks directly to the reader in a relatable way. As William E. Cain, a literary critic, explains in his critique of Walden, “Thoreau's readers are an abstraction to him, not flesh and blood.” Thoreau’s readers appear to be only an abstract, secondary thought for him.  If Thoreau had kept a general audience in mind, he would’ve used simpler, more accessible language. Additionally, if Thoreau had written with the purpose of guiding his readers on how to live a simple life, he would’ve addressed them directly at some point; the fact that he solely writes in first person reveals that he very strictly avoids a conversational tone. Although the text can be interpreted as storytelling that is meant to inspire readers to take their own actions to simplify their lives, there is no direct evidence that Thoreau had the purpose of speaking to his readers. If there were evidence, it would be presented with the use of the word “you,” in order to explicitly engage readers in a conversational way. Skeptical readers may raise the point that Thoreau occasionally uses the words “we,” “us,” and “our”  in his writing, as he does in the chapter “What I Lived For.” He writes, “We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us in our soundest sleep” (Thoreau 72). Here, he appears to address his readers and suggest that it is necessary for them to constantly maintain the “awakeness” of their souls.  However, deeper reading of his language suggests that Thoreau uses the word “we” to address a group of unawakened people that he includes himself in, not necessarily his readers. This means that rather than addressing the readers and telling them what they need to do, he addresses a group of people like himself that may or may not include his readers. Once again, we see that Thoreau does not create a “how-to guide” (Wanye), but a journal of self-reflection. All in all, although Thoreau may appear to be instructing readers on how to live their lives free of society’s complications by following the precedent he set with his experiment at Walden Pond, he actually wrote Walden for his own self-reflection. This is clearly exemplified with his lack of references to his readers and his advanced word choice. Thankfully, while it may not have been the main goal of Walden, readers are still free to interpret the text as a moral handbook that can guide them through their lives to live the free life that Thoreau documented. 	Even the least well-read Americans have the ability to name a few names of classic American literature. Titles that come up may include Frankenstein, The Scarlet Letter, or To Kill a Mockingbird. One story that I wouldn’t anticipate being named is Bartleby. Classic works of American literature are well-known by Americans, have shaped society in some way, and are relatable to many groups of people. While Bartleby may not fit these characteristics, I believe that it fits better in the category of an essential text of American literature. An essential text of American literature is defined as a work that allows for a deeper investigation and understanding of oneself, society, or a time period. This type of writing allows readers to deeply investigate and understand these categories by leading them to ask questions. By asking questions, readers can piece together their own views and understand themselves and the world around them better. Bartleby is an essential work of literature because it leads its readers to ask themselves questions about society. More specifically, it explores individualism and how society should treat those who are different. Some speculative readers may disagree with my categorization of Bartleby as not being an American classic because it was written in 1853 and we are still reading it today; classic works of literature stand the test of time because they are relatable to many groups of people and have shaped society in some way. This is certainly a valid concern, but I would like to shine light on the fact that Bartleby is not a title that is commonly known by Americans. Yes, it is being read by juniors almost 200 years later, but nearly none of my peers (if any) had heard of it prior to our assignment. This is precisely why it is not a classic. American classics are well-known. While it may not be well-known, it makes some insightful judgements on society and individualism. The story follows a scrivener (a copyist) named Bartleby who refuses to do any work, just a few weeks after starting his new job. His boss, the narrator, is originally surprised by Bartleby’s bold refusal to do what he’s paid for, but eventually begins to deeply care for his well being and looks for ways to make him more comfortable. For example, when the narrator learns that Bartleby has been living in their office, he goes as far as to offer to have Bartleby stay in his house until Bartleby can find a place to stay. Bartleby refuses. The story ends with Bartleby starving himself to death in jail. Bartleby takes a radical stance on how individuals should be accepted in society when they refuse to fit in. While Herman Melville may not believe that “normal” people (represented by the narrator) should do everything they can to ensure the acceptance of outcasts (represented by Bartleby), he details that extreme point of view with Bartleby. This leads back to Bartleby’s role as an essential text. The story encourages readers to take a moment to question to what extent society should accommodate outcasts. Outcasts are individuals who blatantly refuse to conform to the “norms” of an environment. While at first glance, Bartleby appears to comment that society should accommodate them to the furthest extent because of the narrator’s considerate treatment of Bartleby, the story actually argues otherwise. It argues that there is a point where society should stop trying to accommodate an individual, which occurs when it is overwhelmingly obvious that the outcast is not willing to do their part. This is exemplified in the story when the narrator’s business is negatively affected by Bartleby continuing to stay in the office after he had been refusing to work for a considerable amount of time. Customers come to give the narrator business, but end up leaving after they ask Bartleby for something, to which he responds with “I would prefer not to.” This is the obvious point that the narrator should’ve given up on Bartleby because, after this, the relationship between Bartleby is frustrating and pointless. Bartleby refuses to accept any of the narrator’s accommodating offers. Their relationship is shown to be pointless because Bartleby ends up being sent to jail anyway, where he dies; the narrator’s troubles were all for nothing. The novel clearly shows that the point at which society should stop accommodating a non-conforming individual is when they show an apparent disinterest in accepting help and cause harm to others. Not only does this essential test exemplify that there is a clear stopping point for accommodations, but it comments upon the idea of individualism. Individualism is the concept of having unique characteristics that cause one to stand out from others. Meville offers the reader two main sides to choose between relating to: Bartleby (the “different” one) and the narrator (the “normal” one, deciding how to react to someone different). Readers can either self-identify as normal or different to add meaning to their experience with the work. Doing the job of an essential text, Bartleby raises the question: to what extent is individualism beneficial? The story has many opportunities to investigate this, with various examples of individualism of different extents in the copying office. Ginger Nut and Turkey both have their eccentricities, like never being satisfied with the height of desks and being exceptionally disagreeable at predictable times of the day, but they represent a typical amount of individualism. The novel argues that those who have a fair amount of unique qualities get by in life with minimal problems. We see this because neither Turkey nor Honey Nut are deeply affected by the events with Bartleby. On the other hand, Melville shows that those on the extreme ends of the “individualism” spectrum run into severe problems. This is shown by Bartleby’s death at the end of the book and the narrator’s numerous charitable attempts being worth nothing because nobody benefitted from them in the end. Bartleby is a complicated and enigmatic text that has been analyzed by countless readers throughout the last two centuries. Even though it is not an American classic because its lack of fame in today’s society, it is clearly an essential text because of its ability to lead readers to ask themselves deep questions. It makes comments on both society and individualism, and is a critical text for anybody who is looking to dig deeper into their own views of the world.			
7/6/2020 19:12:31	Seventy years ago, the school lunch program was established because too many kids weren’t getting enough to eat. The Great Depression had brought poverty to many families, and over ninety percent of the children in coal-mining regions like Illinois, Kentucky, and West Virginia were reported to be malnourished. Today, the problem has been reversed-- according to the American Heart Association, about one in three American kids or teens is now overweight. Besides the difference in availability of food, another factor has led to this dramatic change: the rise of fast food. Greasy, oily, sticky, seemingly delicious fast food. Some schools that need extra funding for their facilities will turn to fast food companies, knowing that more students will buy cafeteria food if it is branded. However, these schools are the ones with the unhealthiest kids. Schools should keep fast food and soft drinks out of their cafeterias, because too much fast food can lead to brain damage, heart disease, and poor physical and emotional health. Schools should not serve fast food in their cafeterias because fast food contains many unhealthy and harmful ingredients, and eating too much fast food will not cause students to feel tired and have trouble focusing in class, but may also cause them to suffer from long-term brain damage. Fast food contains an unhealthy amount of sugars and fats to achieve its appealing taste. However, all the fats and sugars being consumed can cause blood vessels to thicken and narrow.  This limits the amount of blood that travels to the brain. This damage can eventually lead to infarcts, which kills brain tissue. Many people recover from this brain damage, but it could lead to paralyzation, trouble speaking or thinking, and in some cases, death. It is also well known that eating too much sugar will lead to drowsiness. Every day at school, students will need to exercise their brains and think. They can’t do that if their brains aren’t functioning properly. In addition, fast food is loaded with artificial trans fat, which negatively affects the brain. The brain requires cholesterol to function properly, but according to Ruth Kava, director of nutrition at the American Council on Science and Health, “We know that like saturated fats, trans fats can raise bad cholesterol, but there is conflicting data about what it does to good cholesterol." Cholesterol deficiency, or a lack of good cholesterols, has also been linked to Alzheimer's and memory loss. Students will have a much harder time focusing with all the sugar and fats instead of fruits and vegetables in their stomachs. Schools should feed their students foods that are both healthy and allow them to do well in class, instead of muddling their minds. Serving fast food in a school cafeteria will also increase the students’ risk for heart disease. Heart problems used to occur mainly among the elderly, but studies have shown that heart attacks are becoming more common in children who eat a lot of fast food. According to Chew on This, “In 2004, Thomas Robertson had severe chest pain and was rushed to a hospital in New Orleans. He was five foot four and weighed 215 pounds. He often ate fast food hamburgers and fries. Doctors were surprised to find that Thomas was having a heart attack.” (Schlosser, 222) The fats in fast food can cause atherosclerosis, a disease that causes blood vessels to stiffen and potentially become covered in plaque. If a piece of plaque suddenly breaks off, it can block the blood flow in the artery and lead to a heart attack. Researchers have also found that eating too much fast food can lead to heart problems like those of smokers. A 2004 study discovered that some ten-year-old obese children suffer from similar heart problems as forty-five-year-old men who have been smoking for ten years. Fast food is a threat to the cardiovascular health of students, and should not be served in schools. Furthermore, soda and fast food should not be served in school cafeterias because they are leading causes for dental problems, childhood obesity, and can also cause students’ self esteem to lower as a result of having their health-related problems. Fast food and soda have minimal nutritional value, but plenty of chemicals, sugars, and fats. One can of Coca-cola contains thirty-nine grams of sugar. The American Heart Association recommends no more than twenty grams of sugar a day for women, and thirty-six for men. Too much sugar is detrimental and can lead to dental problems. Cavities can start to form at a young age if elementary schools put soda vending machines in their halls and healthy dental care is not promoted. A clean smile can be part of a good first impression, and fearing how people will react to dirty, sugar-stained teeth may lead to lower self esteem in students. Soda may destroy a pearly smile, but fast food can harm the entire body. A single Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad at Applebee’s contains fifty-six grams of fat. According to the Mayo Clinic, “If you're on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, 400 to 700 calories can come from dietary fat, which translates to between 44 and 78 fat grams a day.” Both sugar and fat contribute to obesity, which is becoming more and more common among schoolchildren. Not only is obesity harmful to the child’s physical health, it can also harm their mental outlook. Tamara Pryor, a clinical psychologist and clinical director of the Eating Disorder Center of Denver, states, “A large percentage of overweight kids, particularly girls, have been found to be clinically depressed as a result of their weight problems.” Overall, soda and fast food should not be served in school cafeterias because of the damage they do to a student’s physical and emotional health. In conclusion, fast food and soda are harmful to the health of students and therefore should not be served in school cafeterias. Although they may taste good, fast food and soda contribute to obesity, dental problems, diabetes, depression, heart disease, and a plethora of other negative effects that schools don’t want to happen to their students. The goal of school lunches should be to provide students with healthy, nutritional food that gives them the energy to think and work. Instead, many schools have chosen to serve the high-calorie, low-nutrient menace also known as fast food as a way to earn extra money. There are other ways to provide healthy foods. For example, the Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School in Berkeley, California, has one of the most innovative and hands-on food programs in the United States. A large garden called the Edible Schoolyard is home to a variety of fruits and vegetables, and teaches students about the importance of food in society. A healthy diet is possible for every student, but if schools continue to serve fast food, the damage to the well being of their students will continue.	Throughout history, many bloody and brutal wars have been fought and won. Many of conflicts have been caused by one side believing that they are better than another. In “The Gentle Rain” by Henry Gregor Felsen, the narrator, a bomber jet pilot, is plotting to attack a war-stricken city when he realizes that he is like a God, and chooses to spare the people and bomb a wheat field instead, but then in an ironic turn of events, the narrator discovers that most of the city’s children had been hiding in the field. In the story, the narrator is avenging his friends by bombing the city in which they had died. The narrator states, “I wanted to punish the city whose approaches were littered with the charred remains of my best friends…” As the narrator flies above the city in his bomber jet, he looks “for a tender spot to strike.” After the narrator surveys the city for signs of life, he thinks, “A cowering, miserable beaten city, its people cringing in their holes, awaiting my violent vengeance...That was the moment I knew what it was like to escape morality, and to look down with the eyes of God.” From this point, the narrator believes that he is like God, and superior to to those below him. Now he wants to scare the civilians, not harm them. He believes that this power was given to him for a reason, and that he should use it well, as stated, “I whipped them with sound and chastised them with my thunder, but I spared them out of the goodness of my God-like heart.” He supposes that if he answers the prayers of the people below him, he will fulfill his duty as their God. That is why he decided to bomb a wheat field instead of homes, and his reasoning was that, “there had been a choice between grain and life.” However, this has an ironic outcome. The townspeople thought that the field would be undamaged because it had never been touched in any previous air raids. The narrator had been ready to destroy the city where his best friends had fallen, until he decides to spare the people by bombing a field instead, to show them the carnage they had escaped, but he ends up killing most of the city’s children. Throughout the story, the narrator struggles between the choice to destroy the city or to save its civilians. While he is surveying the city, he has the revelation that he has God-like powers and that he is able to control who lives and who dies. He realizes that he is a God to the people below him, and that he must determine whether to be a God of mercy or one of wrath. He states, “In what inscrutable way would I choose to move, and with what effect on their lives? Red roof or green? Brown roof or no roof? Which cellar would be the tomb, which the haven? Only I knew. I, for the moment, their God above.” In the end, the narrator thinks that if he answers the prayers of the townspeople, he will be worshipped when he reveals himself to a potential Noah or Moses. This shows his greed for superiority and control over others. Earlier in the story, the narrator states, “...I could no longer look on them as enemies or equals. They and their little sins were worth merely a touch of pity, a touch of contempt, and possibly, a touch of destruction. Destruction that would be delivered not as a man’s revenge, but as God’s reproof.” The narrator already thinks of himself as a God, and justifies his actions by telling the reader that they are unbiased, and the work of a sensible God. The narrator’s sense of superiority over the townspeople is evident in the quotes, as the narrator states, “I could no longer look on them as enemies or equals.” The story mainly revolves around the narrator’s indecision over who survives and who dies, which leads to most of the conflict in the story. The use of situational irony is present at the end of the story, when it is revealed that, instead of saving the lives of the townspeople, the field the narrator had bombed had been hiding most of the city’s children. In the story, he states, “From there I intended telling the old man that as much as I hated to destroy the grain, there had been a choice between grain and life, and then to reveal myself to him as his benefactor-- his savior.” This shows that the narrator did not know about what had actually happened, as he says, “There had been a choice between grain and life.” He thought that the field was just an ordinary field that would regrow over time, while the townspeople had probably thought that the bombing of the field was deliberate. He thought that the people would be thankful that he, their God-like savior, had spared them. When the old man says, “When the alarm sounded, we sent all the children to hide in the field.” This is a surprise for the reader, because the story had been told from the pilot’s point of view, and the pilot had not known that he had killed the children. The narrator had been eager to prove his superiority by answering the people’s prayers, and did not think that the children would be in the field; how little the narrator knew about the actual outcome of his destruction made the ending situationally ironic, because the narrator had thought of himself as the townspeople’s benefactor and savior. While the narrator of “The Gentle Rain” tries to decide where his firebombs will hurt the civilians of a city the most, he realizes that he is a God to them, and that the supreme trust given to him should not be betrayed; he decides to spare the people and bomb a field instead, but afterwards discovers that instead of saving the people, he had killed their children, whom had been hiding in the field. In “The Gentle Rain”, the narrator has the revelation that he is God above, and that he controls the lives of those below him. This leads him to believe that he holds godly power over the townspeople he was sent to bomb, which causes him to feel protective over the people. The narrator must decide whether to avenge his friends (whom have died in battle) or to spare the civilians. This is the question the narrator struggles with throughout the story. The narrator decides to frighten the city instead of hurting it, to teach its civilians a lesson, and he fires at a nearby wheat field. Unexpectedly, instead of becoming the city’s savior, he discovers that the field he bombed had been concealing the majority of the city’s children, whom were sent there because it had been left untouched in previous air raids. “The Gentle Rain” shows what happens when a person’s false sense of superiority leads to conflict. The narrator’s aspiration to raise himself to a God-like status ended up in a disaster. 	The nature of science is the process of investigating an idea through experiments and testing. Science involves questioning and proving new concepts, and is the study of the processes that happen in the world. Science is changeable and understandable, but also rigid and based solely on the facts. The thing that sets science apart from other studies is its experimentation, logic, dependability, and flexibility. According to cell theory, all living or formerly living things are made of cells, cells have functions, and cells divide to create other cells. Cell theory illustrates the Nature of Science because the discovery of cell theory was: understandable, based on evidence, a blend of logic and imagination, durable yet subject to change, a complex social activity, and objective. Cell theory was developed through the magnification of living and dead cells. Robert Hooke first discovered cells after looking at cork cells through a microscope and observing what he saw. He concluded that what he saw were cells, and they were part of the plant. Rudolph Virchow hypothesized that cells divide to form new cells based on his observations. Thus, both of these scientists complete the concept of science being understandable. The discoveries were also based on evidence, since they observed the cells and made hypotheses on what they saw. New cell theories were discovered as further proof for previous ones. For example, after Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann observed cells in different types of plant and animals, respectively, they concluded that all living things were made of cells. This built on Hooke’s cell theory and expanded it. These contributions are an example of the nature of science because they were helped others understand a previously unimagined concept and potentially find ways to improve what had already been established. These four scientists had to remain objective while observing cells, or people could get  the wrong idea of what a cell was. Their ideas were built off of each other's, which helped cell theory become what it is today. Their discoveries opened the world of science to a whole new frontier, and previously, no one had imagined that cells exist. Cell theory is also an imaginative concept because these scientists had to contradict the beliefs of their era by suggesting that cells were an integral part of living things. Their discoveries fulfilled the idea that science is always changing and can be changed. Cell theory is an example of the nature of science because it exemplifies the basic concepts of the nature of science. Both cell theory and science are understandable, evidence-based, and always changing. Scientists like Robert Hooke, Rudolph Virchow, Matthias Schleiden, and Theodor Schwann contributed to cell theory, but they used the nature of science to draw conclusions. The nature of science is fundamental to discoveries like cell theory, because it lays out the basic concepts and principles needed to understand science.	In a society where education is highly prized, intelligence can define an individual’s future. But what exactly is intelligence? Its definition has been disagreed upon for centuries, but is often defined as an individual’s ability to effectively interact with others, adapt to new situations, and think for themselves. It’s no surprise that highly intelligent individuals may devote their studies to researching new topics and promoting the arts. For example, in the short story Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes, after Charlie undergoes the operation to triple his IQ, he decides to further investigate the effects of the operation, contributing greatly to science. Intelligence can be either proficiency in a few select fields or the ability to do all common tasks requiring knowledge, as proposed by psychologist Charles E. Spearman in the early twentieth century. Spearman believed that the general ability was especially important, and it is true that people who are intelligent are more likely to be good at many different areas. Leonardo da Vinci, one of the most renowned artists of the Renaissance, was a polymath and made significant discoveries in anatomy, engineering, and science. da Vinci was estimated to have an IQ of around 200 and was an exemplar of the connection between intelligence and skill in many subject areas. Personality is arguably harder to define than intelligence, but a basic description has been agreed upon by most psychologists: the unique set of traits that shape a person’s way of thinking and behavior. It is usually described by using attributes such as extroverted, introverted, considerate, impatient, hardworking, egocentric, e.t.c. The importance of personality is especially prevalent in popular culture; for example, in Veronica Roth’s Divergent series, people are sorted into different “factions” based on their personality: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave, and Erudite (the intelligent.) An interesting thing about personality is that it isn’t always consistent-- the circumstances of an action can greatly affect how an individual reacts. For example, a typically kind person may feel obligated to help a small child find his mother at the supermarket, but will likely behave differently if a suspicious figure asks them for a ride at late at night. Personality can also be affected by a variety of disorders, most of which cause the individual to struggle with social interaction and/or be seen as eccentric or apathetic. There are a few notable correlations between intelligence and personality. First of all, both are substantially affected by genetics and environment. Children are likely to copy the behavior of their parents and friends, and education can boost an individual’s intelligence level. Genetics accounts for about 50% of the differences in personality between individuals, as shown in studies done on identical twins raised in separate environments, and most of the dissimilarities in intelligence are also the result of genetics. Secondly, intelligence has often been used as a way to describe one’s personality, and higher intelligence may indicate a more complex personality. Finally, research has shown that some learning deficits can cause psychological problems, illustrating a connection between personality and intelligence. 			
7/6/2020 19:49:38	Time was up. Now the struggle begins. I was born in 2003. A cute, little baby I was. Wrapped in a soft, white blanket, in the hands of my mother, as her eyes were gleaming with joy. Her first baby, I, was someone who she would protect and care for, love and play with, scold and teach. Her first baby who she would look over for the rest of her life, while enjoying every moment. I was just a baby. Who knew that I would advance to be the person I am today. I was five when the kickoff for the rest of my life began. Kindergarten was horrible. The rambunctious kids, colossal classroom, it all seemed new to me. I was cognizant of the fact that this would be my home, and the kids would be my family, for the next year, so I adapted. Then I grew, evolved. As I grew, my mind grew. I became smarter, learned new concepts, and understood the world better. I knew the difference between right and wrong, and why the phenomenon of our world happened the way they did. It was all too easy. Too easy, in fact, that there was no need for me to put any effort in school. Studying seemed useless. Even without picking up my books and reading the information, I did marvelous on tests, and maintained good grades. I was an exceptional student. I just put the sharp tip of the pencil on the smooth surface of the paper and poured my brain onto it, extracting all the information that was held in the vast reservoir of my head. Then, I realized that I needed something more lively. I needed something more challenging. Something that would motivate me to work harder, something that would be entertaining, unlike the monotonous middle school life, which filled me with ennui. Then, one day, as I was walking through the boisterous halls of middle school, I heard it. I heard a group of individuals, conversing about a wonderful school. A school for intellectuals. It was called TJ. Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I was intrigued and knew this was the place where I could put my potential to use. This was where I wished to be. I knew it was not going to be easy. The challenges that I would have to face would be difficult. I was determined, but first, I would have to show my skills. The TJ test was the one obstacle blocking the path to my goal. If I wanted to go to TJ, I would first have to first pass this test. It was definitely going to be stressful, but I had to pass to get what I wanted. So, I started practicing everyday. Rigorous practice taught me many things. Some of which would help me on the test, and some of which would be useful in everyday life. As I practiced more and more, I achieved better and better scores. I felt ready. I felt like I could take the test right now, and pass. But then I remembered. This wasn’t middle school, it wasn’t going to be this easy like middle school. This was an entrance exam to one of the toughest high schools in the country. I would have to change my ways, work harder, and put more effort. If I envisioned that this test was going to be a breeze, I was bound to be mistaken. After many more months of constant practice, the day was finally here. I woke up to the birds chirping, wishing me good luck. After getting ready, I had a filling breakfast, knowing that I would need it. It was cold. I wore my sweatshirt, feeling its warmth envelop my body. I put everything I would need in my bag. Pencils, erasers, calculator, these were all necessary. Finally, I would be taking the test that I had been practicing for so many months. I got into the soft, warm seats of the car, and waited patiently for my dad to come. Then, he came, and we were off. I was nervous. When we arrived, I saw a crowd of kids, waiting in line to enter the building. The cold was intense, but no one seemed to care. I slowly opened the car door, and placed my feet on the hard, gray road. As I was walking towards the building, I thought back to these past few months. I thought about why I was here, why I was about to take this test. I just wanted to challenge myself, not live a dull life where every day was almost the same as the previous. That’s why I was here. All these thoughts were flooding my brain, but if I thought about it too much, I wouldn’t be able to concentrate on the test. So I pushed it away. I was happy. Knowing that all the effort I put into this one test would pay off was a happy thought. Time was up. But I knew, that I was ready.	One day, in chemistry class, we conducted the coinium lab. We were given 100 pennies and were told to demonstrate how half-lives worked. For the experiment, we flipped the coins, counted the number which were facing heads up, and got rid of the rest, until there was only one penny left. After doing the lab, Mrs. Chhabra explained to us that radiocarbon dating uses the amount of carbon-14 remaining in a dead organism to determine when the organism died. This procedure is useful for understanding history, and a wide variety of studies use radiocarbon dating including archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology. One topic that interested me was using radiocarbon dating to figure out how old certain species of plants were. This is done by extracting phytoliths from the plant and conducting radiocarbon dating on these phytoliths to determine when the plant died. A phytolith is a fossilized particle of plant tissue that can be extracted using certain methods. Quite recently, what scientists found was the radiocarbon dating of phytoliths returned results which were much older than the actual dates of these plants. They suspected the extraction methods were to blame. This led researchers to try to find new extraction methods which would supply them with more accurate information when radiocarbon dating was performed. At first, scientists just tested to see if there was something wrong with current phytolith radiocarbon dating. High phytolith producing plants with known collection dates were taken and analyzed (Piperno, 2016). The five plant species used in this experiment were Zea mays, Cucurbita ecuadorensis, Cucurbita ficifolia, Socratea durissima, and Hirtella americana, with two samples of Hirtella americana, one from 1964 and one from 2013.  First, the samples were washed in distilled water and treated with hydrochloric acid to remove carbonates (Piperno, 2016). Then, H2SO4 was added and samples were placed in boiling water. After a couple hours, this step was repeated to completely get rid of all organic material from the phytolith surfaces. After this, they were ready to radiocarbon date. Tin was added before combustion to elevate the temperature of combustion. The combustion reaction is Phytolith + O2 → H2O + CO2. Then, the organic carbon was dated. Results from the experiment (Piperno, 2016) showed that all the plants tested returned fairly accurate dates except the H. americana collected in 1964, which returned 1570-1420 BP (before present). This was because there was herbarium which was not removed during the extraction process. However, according to Santos, Alexandre, and Prior (2016), there was no control in this experiment (Piperno, 2016) which might’ve led to misinterpreted data. In another study, plants with known ages were taken and a new method of extracting the phytoliths was done (Asscher, Weiner, & Boaretto, 2017). Five protocols were conducted. For the first protocol, 1 N of hydrochloric acid (36.5 grams) was applied after using 2.4 g/mL sodium polytungstate (SPT). Applying the hydrochloric for three hours before using the SPT was the second protocol, and both before and after adding the SPT was the third protocol. For the fourth protocol, they only applied the HCL for one hour, and for the fifth protocol, instead of using HCL, they applied 85% H3PO4 for one hour before using the SPT. Then, for all the samples of each protocol, radiocarbon dating was performed, and they found that the first protocol was the best (Asscher et al., 2017). This was because when the phytoliths were extracted using the first protocol, the results showed dates which were closest to the actual dates of the plants that were used. In a recent study by Zuo, Lu, Huan, Jiang, and Wang (2018), they tested the to see if different methods of extracting phytoliths would yield different results when radiocarbon dated, and which one would be better. They collected 10 soil samples from six different archaeological sites in China. Four were from the Shangshan site, two were from the Hehuashan site, and one each from the Mioshan site, Zhuangling site, Guangtaoyuan site, and Maanhe site. Out of the four from the Shangshan site, two would use the conventional method and from the Hehuashan, one would use the conventional method. The rest would use the improved method, which was based on wet ashing. I emailed Dr. Zuo, asking why they decided to use this wet ashing method. She said, “The wet ashing method is the best one which can securely extract phytolith from the soils. I used to try the dry ashing method but failed to extract phytolith without changing their nature because of the higher temperature during the process,” (X. Zuo, personal communication, February 5, 2019). For the improved method, the dry soil was crushed and deflocculated with 5% sodium polyphosphate, and then washed in distilled water. Then, they were oxidized by 250 mL of H2O2 for 12 hours at room temperature, and carbonates were removed using 200 mL of 10% HCl. The fraction that was greater than 250 μm (micrometer) was separated with wet sieving. Clay was removed by gravity sedimentation, and the remaining high resistance materials were oxidized using 200 mL of HNO3 and KClO3 with heating for one hour. The phytoliths were extracted three times by 200 mL of ZnBr2 and washed with distilled water. They were further sieved with 7 μm to remove excess clay particles. Then, they were treated using 20 mL of 30% H2O2, and finally dried at 60 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. The conventional method was the same but the wet sieving of the greater than 250 μm fraction, gravity sedimentation, and HNO3 and KClO3 oxidation was not done. For radiocarbon dating, each sample was combusted at 1500 degrees Celsius to produce CO2, which was then converted to graphite and dated. They found that the samples extracted by the conventional produced dates which were 3000 to 10000 years older than expected, while with the improved method, the results were much more accurate. This shows that the improved method is much better than the conventional method. Another study (Zuo et al., 2016) did a similar procedure and they achieved the same results. Phytolith radiocarbon dating could even improve radiocarbon dating overall. If we find that one specific way of extracting phytoliths gives much more accurate results than the rest, everyone would abandon outdated methods and use the new and improved method. In addition to improving radiocarbon dating on phytoliths, scientists could even use this new information to conduct a similar procedure on animal fossils. Then, we would have access to more accurate information for future research and experiments, which would help future generations understand the past better. 					
7/6/2020 20:10:56	Ivy League education is often viewed as prestigious because of the brand name that they are associated with, however, the skills they provide students may not be worth their mental health and time. In order to answer our question of whether or not Ivy League education is superior to those provided by second-tier schools, we must define what the purpose of a college education is. For the sake of argument, the goal or purpose of a college education is to prepare students to be effective contributors to the workforce while also teaching them independent living skills. Ivy League schools do not do this effectively as they often are not “worth the investment” of college education, or do not provide more benefits to make up for the higher personal costs of attending one of these eight schools. They are often emotionally and financially draining, whereas other schools provide equivalent or better career opportunities while not having the same consequences or effects that an Ivy League education has on students. Many educators also point to the supposed advantage that an Ivy League degree offers in the workplace. However, we find that in actuality, the school that the diploma is not as important as the skills that students acquire through the diploma itself. An Ivy League diploma does not provide a true advantage or a better return for the “investment” because it is unnecessarily expensive as the career opportunities they provide are not that much better, it can cause greater stress and mental health issues in students, and do not provide a career advantage when considering the latitude of a position. One of the main arguments against Ivy League schools is that they are too expensive and do not make up for the cost with greater career opportunities. Some people look at college as an investment, comparing the cost it takes to attend the school to the starting salaries of the students who attend there, as well as the annual wage growth. We can take a look at different statistics to understand the difference between education at different types of universities and allows us to see if Ivy League schools actually ensure a higher salary. The average tuition fees at an Ivy League school for an undergraduate degree is $56,631 for the 2019-2020 school year and $43,820 for the graduate program. This is much higher than the average cost of college, which is $20, 770 for in-state schools and $46, 950 for private schools according to the College Tuition Compare. From Adam Brownlee’s article on Investopedia, we can see that the starting salary for those who attend a public school ($79,927) is not much lower than those who attend Ivy League schools ($85,676). Using a 6.3% estimated annual growth rate, we find that those who attend public universities actually fare better than those who attend Ivy League schools. The 2029 project estimate for students who attend public universities is $147,655 and $158,270 for students who attended Ivy League schools. However, we must take into account the cost it takes to go to these schools, and we can do this by looking at the salary to cost. Public universities have a cost to salary ratio of 1.36, which is much better than the 3.31 for Ivy League schools and 3.91 for private universities. We can conclude from these statistics and predictions or estimates that attending an Ivy League college costs too much in comparison to the salary that its students receive. Not only is an Ivy League education financially inefficient, but it can also be detrimental to the mental health of students due to the stress they cause and the lack of supportive resources. According to a report done by the Ruderman Family Foundation, we know that 25% of Harvard Law Students reported depression as well as anxiety. 20.5% of students felt a heightened risk of suicide, and 66% said they experienced new mental health issues after the started attending Harvard Law. Suicide rates are twice as high at Harvard, and 35% of Princeton students were diagnosed with mental health issues after arriving on campus. When the Ruderman Family Foundation did a report on the eight Ivies as they are supposed to set an example for other schools, they gave Harvard and Cornell D- grades. Princeton, Brown, and Columbia received D’s and UPenn received a D+. Yale and Dartmouth received the lowest grades of F’s. This is a result of the lack of leave of absences, which are mental health breaks that students are guaranteed to be able to have through the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Most Ivies do not allow students to have these even though they are protected by the law. 5 out of 8 Ivy League schools place restrictions on the length of these leaves of absence as well, even though mental health treatment varies between people. Four schools do not allow students to visit the campus while they are on leave of absence, creating social isolation. To better understand the effect this lack of compliance has on students, we can look at two different cases of suicides. To better understand the effect of the lack of support for mental health at Ivy League schools, we can look at an example. Luchang Wang, a Yale student, posted a Facebook status begore committing suicide. She said that she did not have the time to work out her mental health issues at school, and could not risk leaving due to the prospect of never being readmitted. She clearly stated that Yale’s school policy made her hesitant to disclose information about her mental health. Meanwhile, according to College Magazine, schools such as the University of Texas-Austin support mental health by placing MindBody Labs that promote emotional and physical health and cater to each individual student, and also make counselors around the campus to provide support. Therefore, the restrictions Ivy League schools place around mental health limit students while other schools who educate their students just as well support their students better. One of the main reasons many students choose Ivy League schools is to gain an advantage in the workplace, however, they do not provide a true “leg up”. An article done by Dana Wilkie for SHRM interviewed many people who graduated from an Ivy League school  and the effect that this had on landing a job. Nicole Belyna, a field services director for the Society for Human Resource Management, says that while an Ivy League degree can gain the interest of a company, most companies are “savvy enough to know that they need to look at the bigger picture and see all that the candidate brings- relevant work experience, military service, etc.”Amelia Green-Vamos, a trends analyst with Glassdoor tells us that meaningful experience is more important than a college degree to companies such as Google, Apple, and Bank of America. Aside from looking at whether people with Ivy League degrees are hired more, we can also look at how they climb the “career ladder”  after their starting job. David S. Twitchell, the vice president of human resources at Catholic Charities in Manchester, New Hampshire tells us that those with Ivy League degrees succeed due to their personal drive rather than their education. According to Thomas Friedman’s New York Times article, rather than being concerned with where a degree is from, employers are far more concerned about what the degree is and the skills it develops. For example, Women and Gender Studies from Harvard may not work out so well after graduation and get from $20,000 to $60,000, while a business degree from a less selective school can earn almost $84,000. Therefore, Ivy League education does not provide that much of an advantage in the workplace. Although I am arguing against an Ivy League education, I personally believe that a degree from one of these schools can benefit a student in many ways. It can provide greater alumni networks as these schools have existed before the American Revolution, which gives students many different resources and connections. It truly does have an influence in the workplace as those holding degrees from prestigious universities are more likely to gain higher positions and pay, which can also support minority groups by giving them a head start in competitive fields. An Ivy League education can still promote well-roundedness and does not completely focus on academics. When talking about alumni networks, we can clearly see that Ivy League schools offer excellent professors and former alumni that allow individuals to generate new ideas and give them connections to some of the world’s best companies and agencies. According to College Consensus, Princeton University, Harvard, Brown, and Dartmouth are some of the schools with the best alumni networks council as voted on by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education Circle. A 2017 study led by Raj Chetty showed that low-income students who attended an elite school such as Columbia were more likely to reach the top 1% than those who attended a public university. These elite educations especially have an influence on finance, law, and business as according to Ivy League Coach. More than half of all Supreme Court judges attended an Ivy and UPenn is the top feeder school to many finance companies. 40% of leaders of the Top 120 Non Profits and 22% of the Forbes 100 Richest list have Ivy League degrees. According to Jerome Karabel’s Five myths about the Ivy League, we can see that academics are not the only thing they value. Extracurriculars, athletics, and the development of personality are also important. As we can see on Harvard’s activity page, there are many extracurricular activities where students can extend their learning such as club sports teams, orchestras, media and journalism, drama and dance, and more. Therefore, there an Ivy League education can be both disadvantages and advantages depending on each student’s skills and values. 	Stem cells intrigued me with their vitality, and I decided that I wanted to have a hands on experience with them in the Science Symposium. In this event, I was able to present my research, conclusions, as well as my models to other scientists. Specifically, I learned about pluripotent, multipotent, adult, and embryonic stem cells and their practical applications, such as their possibilities in organ transplantation as well as creating opportunities for autoimmune disease treatment. This event lead to a period of personal growth as I realized I want to pursue a career where I was able to work with stem cells, inspiring me to participate in activities that allowed me to have a hands on experience with them. This event lead to me discovering new research opportunities where I was able to learn more about stem cells and their application in other areas of science. This event also inspired me to make a career decision to become a cardiologist who specializes in organ transplantation. After this event, I continued to participate in science and technology competitions such as the National Science Bowl (NSB), Science Olympiad, as well as do projects on developing technologies such as CRISPR CAS9.  In the Science Symposium, I created a multimedia presentation that allowed other scientists to interact with models that allowed me to represent the process of stem cell specialization as well as their usefulness in other fields. I presented research done on different types of stem cells and their uses. I also presented research done at a university where they experimented with human stem cells in mice and their development into nephrons and then into a kidney. They surgically inserted a large artery and vein to provide blood to the developing kidney. This project allowed nephrologists to study kidney diseases as well as organ transplantation opportunities. This inspired me to attend a nephrology conference where I was able to ask meaningful questions that allowed me to expand my knowledge on kidneys and their use of stem cells. In the future, I want to continue to work with stem cells and develop this technology by working with other scientists.  					
7/6/2020 22:33:47	In a dynamic world such as ours, it is significant that the future leaders of our country are prepared to bring comprehension and aptitudes to resolve issues, analyze data, and make accurate judgement. In order to be ready for what is to come, we must involve ourselves in science, technology, engineering, and math, or STEM. This specific interdisciplinary program will set a clear path for us as a society through progression and creativity, as well as drive us with skill and determination. Breakthroughs in STEM can generate a greater future for society by improving the condition of life, actualizing promising ideas, and encouraging a sense of community within us. Firstly, developments in STEM will create a more noteworthy future by enhancing the state of life. GPS, Internet, and medicine are all advancements that STEM engineers have given us. We use these things everyday and do not even realize the amount of hard work designers around the world have given towards helping the needs of our society. Many agencies and corporations in our country use experimentation and investigation to move forward and make decisions for the future regarding the public. Research is the basis of all the knowledge we have collectively and has helped the human race progress over the past centuries, giving all of us a calm sense of living that we take for granted. In addition, movements in STEM will make an unparalleled future for people by making favorable dreams a reality. The first step in solving a difficult problem is identifying what you know, and that starts with STEM. STEM empowers the ideas that we have because the logistics behind a solution includes its scientific reasoning and technological instruments. A continuation of success in STEM will directly lead to producing strong and influential proposals that promote triumph in the coming years because of the science, technology, engineering, and math that is associated. Solutions that are coordinated by STEM educated leaders will thrive due to the experience and skill that STEM provides. Lastly, jumps forward in STEM can make a great future for society by promoting a feeling of unity. This is because when students collaborate and are exposed to STEM, they create a sense of synergy with one another. Also, there is an unfortunate gender gap present in many places, including work settings. When women are involved with STEM, they are inspired to develop innovative creations, but are not represented accordingly. Advancements in STEM will bring people together and eliminate part of an old and inappropriate problem. STEM brings us jointly through teamwork in science and mathematics, and when it does, we feel more as a union rather than individuals. All in all, advancements in STEM create a better future for humans by improving the condition of life, actualizing promising ideas, and encouraging a sense of community within us. STEM is the future of humankind and it is clearly evident that life as we know it will only enhance.						
7/7/2020 12:38:59	Recently after school closed and we were told to stay inside due to the Coronavirus, I realized how much I would miss certain aspects of life before quarantine. One such part of my life is school, specifically the social aspect of school. Although I did not like waking up early for school 5 days a week and doing homework every night, I did enjoy speaking to people, even people I was not friends with. I also enjoyed being part of something big and walking through the halls. The best part of the day for me was lunch and now I realize how much I took those 30 minutes for granted. Talking and messing around with my friends and acquaintances was one of the best parts of school for me. Although I hated the lunch food, I enjoyed the social aspect of school. Now that this part of my life is gone for a very long time I have realized why I should not have taken going to school for granted. Although some of my friends are happy about not having school, I feel differently and believe it is doing me more harm than good. It is sad that it took something like a virus for me to understand how much I depend on school and how it keeps my life structured and somewhat exciting. Although I do not think I will show up to the first day of school in the fall and be super excited to be there, I will stop taking school and all it has to offer for granted because of this experience I had in the last couple months. School was always stressful and gave me a lot of anxiety but it gave me a sense of purpose and some fun, which I wish I had more of now. This situation has really taught me to not take anything for granted even if it is difficult or boring because one day when that activity or thing is not there, I may regret not caring about it or miss its presence in the future as I do now. When school starts next year I will definitely complain less about my work load and waking up early in the morning because I know that some of my close friends in the class of 2020 were unfortunately not given the opportunity to have the end of their school year, which meant no graduation, prom, or all night grad party.  	During my freshman year of highschool, I decided to take Chemistry Honors for my sophomore year. This was a big mistake. I believed that because Biology Honors was easy that Chemistry Honors would be just as easy. This could not have been farther from the truth, at least for me. I quickly realized how difficult Chemistry Honors was going to be during the first few weeks of the school year. I debated dropping the class because it was very difficult and I could not understand the concepts like many of my peers. Most of my friends in that class seemed to be able to easily grasp the content, which made it even more frustrating for me because I felt as though I was the only one struggling and when I went for extra help with my teacher it did not necessarily help much. After having a conference with my counselor, parents, and teacher, I agreed with my parents and my counselor that I should try my best to finish the year in Honors rather than dropping down. I knew that the rest of the year would be a constant struggle but I finished the year in that class and although I did not end with a great grade, I did not quit, which I am proud of myself for doing.That class during 10th grade taught me alot but probably the most important thing I learned in Chemistry did not have to do with Chemistry. It was about myself and that if I don’t want to, I won't quit. I have used this lesson and applied it to other times in my life when quitting would be easy whether it is physically or menatlly. Although I had people help me like my teacher and my mom to study and learn, I was ultimately the one that had to work hard and not give up on myself. After that class I still haven’t had a harder class, even my AP classes are significantly easier, for me. In some ways I am glad that I struggled my sophomore year because it showed me how hard I would work and that I have the ability to not give up even when something is hard.   	From the late 1920’s to the 1930’s, the United States was suffering from the Great Depression; however, Roosevelt’s New Deal allowed more Americans to join the workforce, and World War II ultimately led the economy out of the depression. During the early 1900’s, before the Great Depression, America was changing during the Progressive Movement, but many white’s viewed immigrants as newcomers that were sure to take their jobs that they worked hard to get. Although settlement houses helped incoming Europeans adjust to American life by providing employment and healthcare, the changing economy caused by the Great Depression exaggerated the tension amongst immigrants and middle class Americans who had already been living in the United States for many years because of their different culture, religion, and the increased competition for jobs. Luckily, Roosevelt proposed a New Deal which relieved, reformed, and aided in the recovery of the economy. During the early 1900’s, immigrants from Eastern European countries began to arrive in great numbers in search of religious freedom and more jobs. Immigrants already faced discrimination and were not liked by many Americans. Americans believed that these new immigrants would steal their jobs. Most immigrants continued to live in city slums and work for a small amount of money. This led to an overcrowded population in cities such as New York. Immigrants from other countries were also impacted, The Chinese Exclusion Act, passed in 1882 was not lifted until the 1940’s. This legislation did not allow Chinese citizens to immigrate to the United States. These reasons continued to make it difficult for immigrants to enter, work, and live in the United States peacefully. Roosevelt’s New Deal changed the economy by providing relief, reform, and recovery for the American people. The New Deal created many agencies, programs, and passed legislation. One of these programs was the Work Progress Administration (WPA). It was one of the largest New Deal programs and employed millions men and women to work on public projects such as constructing buildings and  roads. Another program that was created by the New Deal was the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). FERA was aimed at lower class and uneducated Americans by creating unskilled jobs, providing childcare and funding higher education for low income families. One important legislation that was passed by Congress during this time was the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act gave relief to retired people by giving people over the age of 65 retirement payments and gave unemployment insurance. These programs changed the economy of the United States through relief, reform, and recovery. 				
7/7/2020 13:48:44	Kambili does not know any other life than the one she lives. But that changes when she visits her aunt, who she calls Aunty Ifeoma. She realizes what it is like to live a humble life, what it is like to laugh, what it is like to live without her father, and what it is like to speak up against injustice both inside her home and outside in society. When she leaves her aunt’s house, she is changed in many ways. After Kambili first talks back to Amaka at Aunty Ifeoma’s house, she proves to both herself and others that she has the potential to speak up for herself; however, she learns that it does not always result in positive consequences. At Aunty Ifeoma's house, Kambili begins to realize that her words can have power. Right after Kambili says something back at Amaka’s “insults,” her thoughts indicate that she has changed. She thinks, “I did not want to look at Amaka, did not want to see her scowl, did not want to prompt her to say something else to me, because I knew I could not keep up” (Adichie 170). Even though Kambili had said something in response to Amaka’s comment, she still did not want to know what would happen next. She does not realize people would listen to her and already expected to be laughed at since she had never spoken up before. Also, Kambili does not want Amaka to say anything back because she “knew [she] could not keep up,” meaning she would not be able to say anything back to Amaka (170). It was hard enough for her to do it once. Additionally, this sentence is longer than others around it and reflects Kambili’s thoughts at this moment: “scrambled.” Saying something so simple caused Kambili to think so many things at once. It is clear now why she had not spoken up in the past; it was so difficult for her. After Kambili stood up for herself, Amaka replied, “So your voice can be this loud, Kambili,” and suddenly, Kambili’s “scrambled” thoughts stop. Therefore, when Amaka says this, Kambili realizes that other people will listen to her. Before this moment, Kambili hardly shows signs of confidence; but this changes towards the end of the novel. When Kambili eats before Mass and her father finds out, Jaja, Kambili’s brother, takes the blame for her (102). Later, when her father catches Kambili and Jaja looking at a painting of Papa Nnukwu, Kambili’s grandfather, Kambili immediately steps up and takes the blame (209). In the first situation, Kambili is barely able to talk when asked if she was eating before mass: “I swallowed hard. ‘I… I…’” (102). In the second situation, she does not need to even think about what she is going to say: “‘It’s mine,’ I said.” She did not swallow before speaking. She knew exactly what she wanted to say and said it. Kambili also does not say “Papa” after “It’s mine.” She used to do this often when speaking to her father. This change suggests that now she is trying to be firm. Instead of trying to respect her father, she wants her father to respect her. Earlier in the novel, Kambili never said anything to disrespect or offend her father, even if it was not something she believed in. When discussing the corrupt government in Nigeria, Kambili says, “‘God will deliver us,’ I said, knowing Papa would like my saying that” (26). Later, when talking to Aunty Ifoema, Kambili says, “‘Because Papa-Nnukwu is a pagan.’ Papa would be proud I had said that” (81). When talking to her aunt, she already knew that her father would accept what she says even though he was not there to acknowledge that demonstrating how accustomed she is to finding satisfaction from pleasing others. She also never mentions if she herself believes what she says. Her satisfaction comes from the fact that her father would be pleased with her. Later in the novel, when her father finds out she has brought the painting of her grandfather into the house, she yells “No!” at her father (210). So now it is clear that Kambili actually does not care if Papa Nnukwu, her late grandfather, was a pagan or not. She is not satisfied anymore if her father is pleased with what she says, indicating that she has her own thoughts and is not afraid to let her father know that. She also does not think before or after she screams at her father so it is now easier for her to speak up. Kambili herself realizes that she has changed when she sings alongs with the music and does not realize. Amaka says, “‘You were just singing along with Fela.’ ‘I was?’ I looked at Amaka and wondered if she was imagining things.” There is a moment of self-realization here. Kambili “wondered if she [Amaka] was imagining things” (277). This suggests that she did not know until now that she had become more confident and opened up, although others might have known. When Amaka first tells Kambili that she is singing along, Kambili replies asking, “What?” and when Amaka repeats herself, she again asks, “I was?” Kambili really had no idea and had to repeat herself because she was so surprised. She does not realize that she has been singing along, suggesting that it is now easier to open herself up and be confident. In fact, it has started to become second nature for Kambili. There are several instances when speaking up for herself results in both physical and emotional pain, but it does not stop Kambili from speaking her thoughts. From the very beginning, at the Aunty Ifeoma’s house, when Kambili spoke back to Amaka the very first time, Kambili realized that speaking up for herself can lead to positive results. Not only did she gain respect from Amaka, but she was able to make friends with Amaka. This allows Kambili to realize that relationships can change for the better if she was better at voicing her opinions. Later, Kambili confesses her love for Father Amadi, but he does not reciprocate. Immediately after Father Amadi responds to Kambili, she thinks, “He was wrong. He was so wrong” (276). She still believed that there was something more between them even after Father Amadi said that there was not. This may just be how romantic love works, but the old Kambili would have simply accepted that fact. Then Kambili thinks, “I wished I could think about something, anything, so that I would no longer feel” (276). The fact that she did not even want to feel anything indicates how big of an impact the result of her words created. Even after all the physical pain she had endured, when Father Amadi says he does not love her back, she did not want to feel that emotional pain. She has started to finally open up with people, but this allows Kambili to realize the reality is that not everyone will agree with what she says even if she knows she is right. Kambili demonstrates her ability to endure physical pain when her father tells her to move away from the painting of her grandfather and she does not move. As he starts to kick her, Kambili never says anything suggesting that she regrets staying near the painting. She only describes what it feels like. Even though Kambili knows she would be punished, she also knows that she said the right thing and does not want to take it back. Her father then asks, “‘What has gotten into you?’” and, “What is wrong with you?’” and it becomes clear that she has shown other people in her life as well that she has changed and is able to say whatever she thinks (210). Her father clearly sees this change in his daughter. Afterwards, Kambili comforts herself by reminding herself of Amaka’s music and touching the pieces of the painting. Even as she was punished, she still “stood her ground” and continues to do exactly what she is being punished for. She demonstrates how strong she can be and how much she has changed since the beginning.	Mesmerizing voices, fierce monsters, and cunning goddesses are all obstacles Odysseus fell victim to during his journey home. While defeating monsters, Odysseus learned valuable life lessons applicable to the world today, many of which are lessons learned by high school students. If Odysseus attended high school, the ease with which Odysseus is distracted would make him fall prey to procrastination and the way he takes things for granted would drown him in drama.Two obstacles Odysseus encounters, Circe and the Lotus Eaters, are similar to the Procrastination Python, a monster that high school Odysseus would fear because one of his weaknesses is being easily persuaded and distracted. For example, the Lotus Eaters give Odysseus a plant making him forget his home (Homer 9.91-109). He says, “they longed to stay forever, browsing on / that native bloom” (9.103-204). The word “browsing” creates a sense of mindlessness in this land. They did not just forget about their home, they were entranced, unaware they were trapped. Procrastinating works similarly because when time is wasted and work is put off, it is often hard to get back on track, and students lose track of time. Odysseus’ experience with Circe introduces the idea that Odysseus is easily persuaded because Circe offered to release his shipmates as long as Odysseus stayed with her (10.375-391). After a year, his shipmates finally said, “Captain, shake off this trance, and think of home,” again indicating there was a period when Odysseus was oblivious to the original mission (10.521). If Odysseus were in high school, the Procrastination Python would prevent him from maintaining focus when completing homework, likely resulting in poorer performance on tests, similar to the way Circe and the Lotus Eaters detained him from continuing on his journey. Later, Odysseus encountered Lord Helios, who caused Odysseus the loss of his shipmates, similar to what the Drama Dragon does to friendships. Losing his crew is especially hard for Odysseus because he takes his friends for granted. When he arrives at the island where Helios’ cattle graze, he gives a quick warning to his crew to refrain from eating cattle and leaves to sleep (12.350-434). Even though he is the leader of his crew, he never appreciates them for staying throughout his journey or takes time to ensure their safety. Realizing his shipmates perished, Odysseus says, “O Father Zeus… / you made me sleep away this day of mischief” (12.475-576). It is clear that Odysseus blamed Zeus, similar to the way students blame others when experiencing drama. While some students are not involved in drama, Odysseus is a perfect victim for the Drama Dragon. Life lessons learned in high school are important because that is when students transition mentally, from students to adults. It is so significant that it is possible to compare the journey of high school students to the journey of a Greek hero. In both journeys, Odysseus and the student grow after overcoming each obstacle. The Odyssey teaches us to face obstacles with a positive mindset and use them as learning experiences rather than viewing them as monsters blocking the path to success.	As the agriculture industry continues to play an important role in the economy, so does the use of pesticides to maintain maximum production. However, when these pesticides eventually enter bodies of water, they contaminate both the ecosystem and the water humans drink. For humans, exposure to chlorpyrifos, one organophosphate (OP) insecticide, can result in diseases ranging from cancer to neurobehavioral disorders. In a district in Mexico, 80% of farmers that came in close contact with a pesticide, or a mix of pesticides, that participated in the study, was found to have at least one neurological symptom (Serrano-Medina et al., 2019). Moreover, chlorpyrifos remains on the area applied at a higher percentage than any other OP, lingering 93% compared to the 85% of other pesticides (Elgueta, Moyano, Sepúlveda, Quiroz, & Correa, 2017; Li et al., 2017). Due to its difficulty in being cleaned off crops, chlorpyrifos remains on them until digested by humans or animals, spreading throughout an ecosystem. Since many studies are conducted on the effects of chlorpyrifos on certain abilities of organisms, not much is known about the effects of chlorpyrifos on the population size of an organism. Chlorpyrifos is a white, crystalline man-made chemical popularly used in pesticides due to its neurotoxicity. Organophosphates, prevent the AChE receptor from breaking down acetylcholine (ACh), causing ACh, an enzyme vital for the neuromuscular system of humans and insects, to accumulate between synaptic clefts thus blocking the area where nerve impulses are sent (Kais, Stengel, Batel, & Braunbeck, 2015). Additionally, it blocks cholinergic synapses. The combination of these stops nerve impulses and communication to muscles, resulting in the eventual death of the organism (Kais et al., 2015). Women exposed to chlorpyrifos during their pregnancies had a seven-point drop in IQ scores of their seven-year-old children along with a 60% higher chance of having autism (Bouchard et al., 2011; Shelton et al., 2014). When tested on white leg shrimp, chlorpyrifos was found to be more toxic than dimethoate, another popularly used OP, hindering the growth and development of the organism. These effects are increased when exposed to soil and have the capability of destroying the organisms’ aquaculture and increasing their mortality rate (Pawar, Sanaye, Shyama, Sreepada, & Dake, 2019). Over 10 million pounds of chlorpyrifos has been used agriculturally annually (Jameson, Seidler, & Slotkin, 2007), which then moves into runoff and eventually bodies of water, affecting organisms, such as the Hydra viridissima. H. viridissima, or Green Hydra, are cnidarians that live in freshwater ecosystems. These organisms have a tube-like body and an average length of 10 mm, with hatchlings being about 2.5 mm. They have six to ten tentacles that surround their mouth enabling them to move and latch onto objects. Since they only have one opening, both food and waste pass through it (Franzenburg, 2013). Additionally, they reproduce sexually, during late summer and fall, and asexually, during spring and early summer, making them versatile for use in scientific settings. They attach to rocks in healthy lakes and slow-flowing streams as they are sensitive to pollution. Due to this, as well as being affected by changes in biotic and abiotic factors, their population size is reflective of the health of their ecosystem (Kaliszewicz & Lipińska, 2013; Rosa, Bradács, & Tökölyi, 2015). There have been no studies directly linking chlorpyrifos and the population of green hydra; however, studies have been performed to investigate the effects of OPs on population growth for other macroinvertebrates indicating negative results of the insecticides. In fact, OPs extremely changed the way planaria regenerate and reproduce. The mobility of the planaria changed quickly and led to the eventual death at the low concentration of 200 micrometers of two OPs, parathion-ethyl and fenitrothion (Poirier et al., 2017). Khodayari, Abedini, and Renault studied the effects of another fertilizer, Fosfalim-K, applied to cucumber plants to investigate the effect on the reproduction rate of Tetranychus urticae mites, or spider mites. They found that increased levels of this phosphate-based fertilizer decreased the reproduction rates from a net reproductive rate of 14.44 offspring per individual for 1 mL of fertilizer per L of water to 6.62 offspring per individual for 10 mL of fertilizer per L of water (2018). Although there are large amounts of data on the effects of chlorpyrifos and other OPs, the data studies the effects of the OP on specific aspects of the organism such as growth, healing, and regeneration abilities rather than the growth of an entire population. 				
7/7/2020 18:17:40	A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles features Count Alexander Rostov, a charming man who is, in 1922, sentenced to house arrest by the Bolsheviks in a grand hotel for 30 years. The man was a part of the aristocracy and lived in luxury with his grandmother and sister, but must now live in a small attic while some of the most important events in Russian history unfold outside the hotel doors. In more ways than one, Count Rostov is a prisoner. According to Charles Rubin, Amor Towles makes it clear to the reader that the Count was privileged to be a prisoner in the Metropol Hotel, but also portrays that he had his own demons to battle, like boredom and a sense of pointlessness driven by the monotonous and insubstantial routine of his life (Rubin 142). Still, many people in Russia were not as lucky as the Count is. In The Russian Review, K.F. Shteppa informs us that, in the mid-to-late 1900s in Russia, people were accused of crimes almost every day and taken to prisons so far removed from society that their family and friends were likely to never see them again (Shteppa 38). Although Amor Towles stays true to the Bolsheviks’ treatment of their prisoners through some of the supporting characters in A Gentleman In Moscow and their arrest and subsequent work in forced labor camps, he ultimately deviates from historical accuracy by sentencing the main character, Count Alexander Rostov, to house arrest in a lavish hotel with no occupation in order to highlight that the prisons in Soviet Russia were particularly brutal because they forced the prisoners to repent their crimes in specific and controlled ways. The prisoners in Russia during the early-to-mid 1900s were given jobs instead of being able to choose what to do with their time in the prisons. Valery Abramkin, who is quoted in the Daily Telegraph, said from first-hand experience that no one should go through what he went through in forced labor camps as a political prisoner during Communist rule (Daily Telegraph). M. N. Chatterjee, who visited a prison in Soviet Russia and was given a tour by one of the prison guards, wrote that many of the gulags, the people who oversaw the prison systems, called the prisoners colonists and said that they were required to work because, “what the individual colonist does is of great importance not only to himself but also to his fellow colonists.” The “prison” that Chatterjee had gone to was a textile factory (Chatterjee 362). Over time, the system that the gulag created evolved into economic support for the Soviet Union. According to Helen Rappaport, Joseph Stalin would have never been able to industrialize the Soviet Union at such a large scale if the laborers did not exist, which was even more of an incentive for the Bolsheviks to continue forcing any type of prisoner to work for them (Rappaport, “Gulag”). Towards the beginning of A Gentleman in Moscow, Count Alexander Rostov has a mostly concern-free life in the Metropol Hotel. He often sleeps thinking about the boring consistency of his life and what, if any, meaning he has. Because of his belief that he serves no purpose now, the Count later begins to ponder the option of committing suicide. In the days leading up to his decision, he notices, “When he crossed the lobby, it often took a full minute for his closest friends to notice that he was standing right in front of them” (Towles 132). Even Nina, the person that he could most count on to give him an adventure to go on the days he feels most useless, begins to favor her learning endeavors over his company.These epiphanies leave the Count feeling as if all his peers are serving their purpose in life while he is left alone in a gargantuan hotel with nothing to do. Count Rostov does not commit suicide, however, and eventually finds his purpose in his job as a waiter at the Boyarsky. When the Count’s friend, an aspiring writer and supporter of the Communist Party named Mishka, visits him and sees him at the Boyarsky, he says, “Who would have imagined when you were sentenced to life in the Metropol all those years ago, that you had just become the luckiest man in all of Russia” (Towles 234). When he is first arrested, the Count often had found himself feeling envious of his friend because he was able to further his passion freely and outside the confines of a prison. However, when Mishka soon realizes his mistake in supporting the Communist Party and gets sent to a labor prison in Siberia as a result, the Count realizes his good fortune in being able to choose how to give meaning to his life even though he is an inmate. The contrast between Mishka’s and the Count’s life in much like the contrast between the historical treatment of prisoners in Russia and the fictional portrayal of imprisonment in this novel. People who opposed the views of the Communist Party were thrown in forced labor camps to work in places like textile factories. These people, just like the Count, had jobs that they wanted and passions they wanted to pursue. However, when they were arrested, the gulags decided what they were to do for the rest of their lives. The Count, in contrast, had no one in the Metropol Hotel to tell him what to do. He was left to do whatever he wanted in the confines of his prison, and while he did feel pointless for a while, he eventually did something with his passion for food. This helps him find peace with his situation and led him to live his life to the fullest extent. The so-called corrective camps in Russia in the mid-1900s also had an administrative body that oversaw the labor systems. They were called gulags and were often unnecessarily violent and cruel with the prisoners. According to Helen Rappaport, they pitted the inmates against each other, encouraging them to report even the smallest misstep in exchange for more room in their cramped camps (Rappaport, “Gulag”). The intense scrutiny could sometimes cause the prisoners to go mad; paranoia, and therefore violence among prisoners, was prevalent within the barbed wires of the labor camps. Mary Conroy reported that the death rate among Soviet prisoners increased by about 15% from 1917 to 1936 (Conroy 1257). Meanwhile, Count Rostov has mostly friendly company in the Metropol Hotel. The concierge, Vasily, is an amiable acquaintance, the head waiter, Andrey, in the Boyarsky is a good friend, and the seamstress is a trusted confidante. However, the Bishop, a tactless Bolshevik and the eventual manager of the hotel, becomes obsessed with scrutinizing the Count. When the Bishop removes all the wine labels from the bottles in the Boyarsky in order to “equalize” them in accordance with Soviet ideals, the Count thinks, “Yes, a bottle of wine was the ultimate distillation of time and place; a poetic expression of individuality itself. Yet here it was, cast back into the sea of anonymity, that realm of averages and unknowns” (Towles 144). Even though the Count is not in a traditional corrective labor camp, some of his freedoms are still taken away. Still, because of his makeshift family in the Metropol Hotel, he is able to overcome hurdles such as these, which is vastly different from the way prisoners have historically dealt with unjust circumstances in Soviet prisons. In the gulag labor camps, guards made the conditions so that the inmates would see each other as enemies. Therefore, each new problem that the prisoners faced, such as decreased food rations, was faced by themselves, and often to no avail. In contrast, the Count chose his friends early on in his house arrest, and they are often the ones to help him out of a crisis. For example, when the Count’s daughter Sofia needs to be taken to the hospital, he walks out of the Metropol Hotel, even though he is legally not allowed to. However, his friend, Osip Glebnikov, who is a former Colonel of the Red Army, pulls some strings to make sure that no other Bolshevik finds out. The Count, because he was given the freedom to choose how to interact with his peers in his prison, is able to make the best of his 30-year sentence to house arrest. Fortunately, prison systems have evolved over time to become less controlling. According to The Marshall Project, in America, some prisons allow their inmates to choose their own job, such as being on suicide watch for young prisoners (Metcalf, “The Marshall Project”). This freedom to choose their own fulfillment allows prisoners to rehabilitate in their own time and way, without it being forced and, thus, unconstructive. Amor Towles emphasizes this point by deviating from the historical accuracy of prison systems in Bolshevik Russia. Although Amor Towles stays true to the Bolsheviks’ treatment of their prisoners through some of the supporting characters in A Gentleman In Moscow and their arrest and subsequent work in forced labor camps, he ultimately deviates from historical accuracy by sentencing the main character, Count Alexander Rostov, to house arrest in a lavish hotel with no occupation in order to highlight that the prisons in Soviet Russia were particularly brutal because they forced the prisoners to repent their crimes in specific and controlled ways.  	As evidenced by the events of history, women were, for the most part, almost always considered inferior to men. Different cultures had and still have varying ways of treating their women, and, although there has been much progress on female rights and treatment, there are still big steps to be made. To help completely solve this problem it would be important to understand why women have been considered beneath men throughout history. A way to go about this would be to look at works of literature from around the world. For example, Antigone from Greece and Things Fall Apart from Nigeria show many aspects of a women’s treatment in society. Although there are other factors affecting their opinions on females, the main characters’-Creon’s and Okonkwo’s-perceptions of women are mainly influenced by the female willingness to express emotions. Okonkwo believes that women are weaker than men because they express compassion for their peers. After Okonkwo kills Ikemefuna, a prisoner of sorts from a nearby village whom he had come to think of like a son, he mourns for days. However, he realizes his weakness and thinks, “How can a man who has killed five men in battle fall to pieces because he has added a boy to their number? Okonkwo, you have become a woman indeed. (Achebe 65)” Okonkwo feels guilty that he killed an innocent child, but shuns his emotions as a flaw. Instead, he attributes his apparently misguided sadness to femininity, which he thinks is not compatible with heroism. As a result of this thinking, Okonkwo becomes bitter about his punishment of staying in his motherland, and Uchendu, seeing this, explains to him, “It’s true that a child belongs to its father. But when a father beats his child, it seeks sympathy in its mother’s hut. A man belongs to his fatherland when things are good and life is sweet. But when there is sorrow and bitterness he finds refuge in his motherland. Your mother is there to protect you. She is buried there. And that is why we say that mother is supreme. (Achebe 134)” Women, especially mothers, represent the compassion that fathers cannot always give to their children, which is why men are exiled to their motherland from their fatherland. Despite this revelation, Okonkwo continues to disrespect women because he has a fear of becoming like his father, who was both soft-hearted and cowardly. Creon, from Antigone, is vastly different from Okonkwo’s father too. Creon deems women to be inferior to men because they let love control their actions. For example, when Creon is deciding the punishment for Antigone, he says, “Who is the man here, she or I, if this crime goes unpunished? (Sophocles 209)” Creon believes that it would be unmanly of him if he did not punish Antigone just because she is his sister’s daughter. He thinks that emotion is only for women, by implying that only a woman would let her love for her relative overrule the supposedly just thing to do. He reasons that emotion is a sign of weakness in the face of justice, so he attributes it to women, who he thinks are weak. Because of this, Creon also ridicules men who are influenced by women. When Haimon defends Antigone because of his love for her, Creon scorns him, saying, “Fool, adolescent fool! Taken in by a woman! (Sophocles 221)” Haimon is defending Antigone mainly because he loves her, rather than for justice. If Antigone was not his fiancé, he would not have opposed his father as strongly as he did, as evidenced when he says he is willing to die if Antigone gets killed. This is why Creon starts insulting his son; Haimon is letting emotion dictate his actions. The root of Creon’s prejudiced view of women is his dislike for emotion over action. It could be said that Creon’s and Okonkwo’s unfair views of women come from their societal context. When Antigone asks Ismene to help her bury their brother against Creon’s will, Ismene argues, “And do what he has forbidden! We are only women, we cannot fight with men, Antigone! (Sophocles 191)” Ismene, although she herself is a woman, does not believe that she can go against the wishes of a man. However, this is not her fault, because she has only ever known the male-dominant society of Thebes. Similarly, during the yam festival, Achebe informs us that the Igbo people think, “Yam, the king of crops, was a man’s crop. (Achebe 23)” Because the yam is a difficult crop to harvest, men are thought to be able to provide their families with yams, rather than the women, who they think can’t work hard enough to grow them. Nevertheless, Creon’s and Okonkwo’s society has these views about women in the first place because of their dislike of the emotion that women seem to willingly show. Because these characters have only ever known their city or village, Creon and Okonkwo inherit this aversion to emotion, rather than a direct disrespect for women. Creon, from Antigone, and Okonkwo, from Things Fall Apart, have opinions of women that are influenced by the emotion that women show. These two works of literature are from different cultures, yet they show a common way and reason for treating women, albeit in different ways. This understanding of why women have historically, and throughout cultures, been considered subordinate to men can help make more progress in female rights today. 	Charlotte Temple ​by Susanna Rowson deals with gender in a subtle manner, under the larger storyline of a young girl being seduced and then abandoned in America by a British soldier. The novel, which takes place in the late 18th century, starts with John Montraville seeing and then becoming infatuated with a school-girl named Charlotte Temple. He eventually succeeds in his goal of persuading Charlotte to go with him to New York with the help of his cunning friend, Belcour, and Charlotte’s selfish teacher, Mademoiselle La Rue. Throughout the novel, Rowson strikes a stark difference between the actions and values of the male and female characters. Although some of the characters in ​Charlotte Temple ​value love over everything, Susanna Rowson emphasizes that males mostly value wealth and women largely value shallow qualities such as reputation, with the aim of telling her readers that men and women usually conform to traditional roles. Mr. Temple’s father and Mademoiselle La Rue are two characters that Rowson describes as being selfish, although for different reasons. Mr. Temple’s father is aghast when his son tells him that he intends to marry the poor Lucy Eldridge rather than the rich Miss Weatherby. He says, “...be so kind as to turn your eyes on Miss Weatherby; who, having only an estate of three thousand a year...” (Rowson 18) When his son refuses to marry her, Mr. Temple’s father marries Miss Weatherby himself, mainly due to the large fortune that she had inherited. La Rue is introduced as a selfish character as well, due to her affinity to start and end relationships with men rather quickly. Towards the beginning of the novel, Rowson describes La Rue by writing, “...though she knew Miss La Rue had eloped from a convent with a young officer, and on coming to England, had lived with several different men...” (Rowson 23) As indicated by La Rue’s many descriptions throughout the book, she becomes quickly attracted to different men due to her changing infatuation. Many of the men she seduces are army officers, such as Belcour, due to their positive reputation in society. Mr. Temple’s father and Mademoiselle La Rue both show what they value through their actions, but the former by his desire for wealth and the latter by her desire to gain a positive reputation in society. In contrast, Rowson portrays John Montraville and Mrs. Beauchamp as being honorable, if not flawed, characters because of their ability to ignore their desire for wealth and reputation, respectively. Rowson tells the readers that Montraville’s family would not be happy with his relationship with Charlotte because of her lack of a great fortune. Nevertheless, he courts Charlotte and takes her to New York, with the intention of living a happy life with her. However, he soon meets a rich heiress by the name of Julia Franklin, and forgets about the young girl he had left behind. Although initially ignoring his family’s desire for him to marry wealthy, he quickly loses interest in Charlotte and puts all his attention on Julia, showing that he eventually went back to his need for material happiness. In contrast, Mrs. Beauchamp overcomes her initial instinct to not help Charlotte because of the social ostracism she knew she would suffer. When she first sees Charlotte weeping, she says, “Dear sufferer, how gladly would I pour into your heart the balm of consolation, were it not for the fear of derision.” (Rowson 77) Eventually, she decides to help her. Montraville and Mrs. Beauchamp show what they value through their initial inclinations: Montraville by his short-lived ability to ignore his desire for wealth and Mrs. Beauchamp by her ability to ignore her desire to have a good reputation. Mr. Temple seems to not value wealth; he marries the poor Lucy instead of the rich Miss Weatherby due to his love for the former. However, although he might not want wealth for himself, he often helps his peers by lending money to them. Rowson says of him, “...nor was it seldom that he sought out indigent merit, and raised it from obscurity...” (Rowson 6) Mr. Temple’s tendency to donate money as opposed to other things indicates that he values riches. Sussana Rowson uses ​Charlotte Temple​ to emphasize that men value wealth while women value reputation, to prove that they conform to their expected roles. At the time the novel was published, the late 1700s, the idea of “Republican Motherhood” was taking root in American society, improving the rights given to women. However, men were still the ones involved in finance and politics, while women were more involved in home life and relationships. Rowson was a big advocate for changing this dynamic, and ​Charlotte Temple​ reflects this through its tragic ending, which mainly happens because of the traditional roles that its characters fall into.				
7/7/2020 21:11:52	More than 45 million students owe student debt according to CNN. The total student debt is a whopping $1.6 trillion with an estimated $1.5 trillion in federal loans and $119 billion in private student loans. This debt surpasses all of the other debt that people can have, including housing mortgages and car loans. Nearly 1 in 4 federal borrowers are in default or cannot pay on their current loans. The Moody’s Investors Service report states that the rising college enrollment rates and tuition costs are the driving forces behind the increase in student loans but slow loan repayments have also contributed to the mounting debt. Repayment schedules for these student loans often span years, even decades at a time, with large monthly payments. Economists at Business Insider project an accumulated student loan debt of $2 trillion by 2021, and, at a growth rate of 7% a year, as much as $3 trillion or more by the end of the decade. Rising tuition costs of college and university can be pointed to the fact that there has been a major reduction in state support and public investment in higher education has decreased since the 1980s. State funding and subsidies were cut more than $7 billion between 2008 and 2018. This has caused most of the costs that states would usually cover on students and their families. The student loan debt affects household finances as it affects the credit that people can have which includes mortgage and small business loans. These factors increase economic growth and promote the creation of wealth and with the increasing loan debt, the growth of the economy may be reduced. There are 529 college savings plans that can help with paying for college expenses but only 21% of families use them according to Salie Mae’s 2019 How America Pays for College Report. 51% of families borrow to pay for college, including loans taken out by both students and parents. In addition, the gender pay gap often prevents women from making the same progress in paying off their loans as men. In 2019, women working full-time earned approximately 82% of what men earned that same year. Lower income means less money to put towards getting rid of that student debt. All of these statistics could prevent people from spending more money and investing in the economy which could lead to slower economic growth in the long run. One popular possible solution to the student debt crisis, proposed to the Congress by Senator Elizabeth Warren, is the Student Loan Fairness Act. This act would make the student loan interest rates the same as the federal reserve interest rates because currently, people with student loans are paying nine times that amount. Unfortunately, if this act had passed, borrowers would be less likely to make informed decisions when taking out loans due to the many forgiveness aspects. This means that college tuitions will rise and there is no guarantee that their income will be able to keep up with that rise. Another solution that is often considered “radical” is canceling all student debt. According to the Levy Institute, this action will stimulate the economy by “$86 billion to $108 billion per year” and reduce unemployment. However, this does mean that the government would have to forgive $1.6 trillion of debt. Senator Bernie Sanders’s possible solution to this problem is to make college free. Although this would eliminate college tuition, it still does not eliminate the other costs of going to college such as food, clothing, etc. Faith Keith of Leverage Retirement believes that the root cause of the student debt crisis is the lack of financial knowledge. Students that do not have a concept of managing money are taking out loans and do not know what they are getting themselves into. One way to combat this would be to require students to take money management courses prior to being granted student loans. Matthew Cuplin of the Midwest Financial Group believes that in order to solve the student debt crisis, America needs to reform the expenses of college. This is because the cost of college tuition is not the only cost students have to cover as they have to pay for basic necessities. The Forbes Financial Council is in agreement that cancelling all student debt is just a temporary fix to the student debt crisis and does not address the underlying issues such as colleges taking advantage of the financial illiteracy of students. In order to solve the student debt crisis, lawmakers need to implement a solution that not only eliminates the problem but also prevents the student debt crisis from occurring again. 	In Harold Ickes’s speech in New York City, Ickes persuades the people of the United States to join in the Second World War to help the British and help democracy prevail. Ickes uses a rallying tone to persuade his audience into fighting against the Nazis and uphold the ideals of freedom. Using this tone, Ickes delivers this speech using appeals to justice and historical examples so that American citizens can get inspired and join the fight against the Nazis and preserve democracy. Ickes immediately starts his essay by pointing out the fact that the British are fighting and every person around the world needs to help them in order to preserve freedom. He opens his essay by saying that the war “is a desperate struggle for the possession of the souls of men.” This opening already has a dark undertone running through, causing people to see the horrific magnitude of the scale of the Second World War. Ickes immediately relates this war as something people deeply care about that it's enough for them to lose their souls over. Ickes then says that “freedom-loving men and women in every land must organize and tighten their ranks” in order to “fight their oppressors and conquerors.” Ickes immediately uses ethical appeals and makes it seem that people who do not fight in this war do not care for the people who are being oppressed. Ickes says that “democratic Americans are in a position to help,” implying that people who do not believe in democracy are not American and do not hold the ideals of America. The people who are truly American would fight in this war and help the British succeed in their fight against the Nazis. Ickes uses these appeals to persuade the American public that they need to go to war. If they do not go to war, then they do not represent the core values of America which is freedom and democracy. His tone is rousing, already in the start of the speech, to make the American citizens feel a sense of duty to fight in this war. Ickes uses the appeal for justice to inspire people to join the fight and make them recognize that the war does not just involve the Nazis and the British, but it involves the whole world. Ickes then goes on in his speech to show how people around the world have fought for freedom and that it should not end now. He points to various different stages in history where people have fought for liberty and freedom such as when “the Poles have for centuries maintained a heroic resistance against tyranny.” Ickes uses a vast variety of historical examples in order to show the American people that freedom is not just an ideal held by the United States, it is held by the entire world. It is in America’s hands to help protect that freedom from a great threat as it is truly a world war. The ideals of freedom have never faded through the test of time and Ickes wants to prove to the American people that freedom is something that Americans have to fight for, since it does not come easily. Ickes says that “the Hitlers flash and sputter out. But Freedom endures.” Ickes drives the point that freedom is the only thing left standing after tyranny and conflict, but the people oppressed have to fight for it. They have to fight back against their oppressors. The United States is a world power in a position to help these people fight back. Since the United States has the values of freedom, they are in perfect shape to make sure that freedom never disappears. These historical examples have a rallying tone as Ickes shows that people before have fought for freedom so the United States should do the same and fight for the freedom of the world. The tone reaches Americans and makes them understand that they have a part in this war and they have to fight in order to preserve liberty. Ickes garners support of his fellow Americans by talking about everlasting freedom, implying that the American people are uniquely positioned to make a stand against tyranny. In Ickes’s closing paragraphs he relies on America’s sense of obligation to help people who are oppressed and are fighting for freedom. Ickes points out that “freedom still lives in the hearts of men” even if the Nazis believe that they have “destroyed democracy.” Ickes uses these phrases to go into a simile likening the freedom still resides in people as a tree, hardening in the wintertime and blooming in the spring. The season of spring is where the tree blooms and flourishes. The freedom that lives within people will grow and spread as there will be a “democratic revolution.” Ickes uses the simile and precise diction to show that freedom will always continue to prevail no matter how long it takes. Ickes says that the people who are oppressed “are only waiting for our leadership,” implying that the United States is the catalyst to start the season of spring early and create the revolution of democracy. The United States is the only country capable of helping other countries fight for freedom. Using these words, Ickes gathers support of the American people in fighting the war because they now feel a sense of duty to help the people who are being oppressed by the Nazis. They feel a need to fight against the dictators because the citizens of America are the only people capable of helping others fight against the evilness of Nazis. Icke insists that the American people “must give the British everything… needed to beat… [the] common enemy.” Icke presses the point that the American people are the only people capable of ending the war. The war is going on and people need to act swiftly and deadly because “the fight for Britain is in its crucial stages.” The war is continuing to rage on while Ickes talks so he carries the point that it is important to fight immediately and make sure that people are helping “friends and allies everywhere.” Ickes finishes his argument with the closing line of “here in America we have something so worth living for that it is worth dying for.” Ickes’s rallying tone continues on and becomes the strongest during his last lines and his call to action. This tone allows him to call to all Americans who feel that it is their duty to make sure that democracy prevails. Ickes’s tone creates a connection because his audience and himself as they all believe that freedom and liberty should be the core values that Americans fight for. This line brings home the point of America’s sense of justice and obligation to fight for freedom. Ickes implies that Americans will stop at nothing to make sure that the world gets the freedom that it deserves and that it is America’s duty to fight for what is right and uphold democracy as a beacon of hope across the world. Ickes crafts a carefully worded speech to persuade the American people into joining the Second World War and upholding the ideals of freedom, liberty, and democracy. Ickes’s intricate use of appeals to justice, coupled with historical examples allows for Ickes to rouse the American people into fighting in the war and rally them to fight for the continuation of democracy. 					
7/7/2020 22:59:06	I was working on my homework when a news segment appeared on our T.V. that caught my attention. It was a segment that was talking about a place in Los Angeles, California called Skid Row. They explained Skid Row is a place lined up with hundreds of tents, all which house homeless people living in L.A. One of the news reporters went up to a person living on Skid Row and asked them why they had to live there, and the person responded by saying “I don’t have a job.” These are five words that ring true for millions of Americans—a phrase no one should have to live. There are many issues our world faces today, all which people prioritize differently.  Climate change, poverty, and lack of education are among those issues. The reason I wish to end unemployment is that by ending unemployment, many other global issues can be solved. I wish to change the world by decreasing unemployment, and I will do this by implementing charitable organizations, working with global governments, and promoting education-based programs. Charitable organizations have always been a way for people to champion and aid an issue. To begin with, charitable organizations go into the frontlines to help them serve their mission. For example, UNICEF is a charitable organization that serves over 190 countries to help defend and create more rights for children. In the memoir Balcony on the Moon: Coming of Age in Palestine, the author talks about how UNICEF was able to help her fulfill her ambition of becoming a writer by giving her the proper schooling. That is just one of the thousands of ways UNICEF has helped children across the globe. Another example is how charitable organizations bring more awareness to the issues they combat. To illustrate, since the creation of the National Breast Cancer Foundation, much-needed attention has been brought to the issue of breast cancer. Now, schools across the nation have breast cancer-related spirit days and the entire world takes part in Breast Cancer Awareness Month. To conclude, this all proves the relevance in creating organizations to help solve the issue of unemployment.To solve unemployment efficiently and on a global scale, we must work with all of the governments in the world. For example, working with these governments would allow our work to be localized and therefore implemented much quicker. For instance, if, instead of working with a country’s government, we were to work with an existing UN organization. Even if we instituted legal reform with the UN to combat unemployment, it would still take months, perhaps even years, for that reform to be fully implemented locally, since the UN isn’t localized. But if we are able to work with those local governments, we would be able to work closer to the source and therefore be able to take much-needed action faster. Also, if we as an organization take action, the majority of our work would likely be temporary. For example, if we were to help someone get a job with a company and then leave, there could be a possibility that that person loses their job. And if they do, they would have nowhere to go like before. But if we were able to work with these governments and take proper legal action by passing and implementing bills and laws regarding unemployment, much of the action we take would be able to remain permanent. Therefore, working with global governments would be key for me to solve unemployment. By ending the lack of education across the globe, many other global crises could be solved, crises which include unemployment. To demonstrate, the majority of unemployed people in America are without a degree. That is evidence that a root cause of unemployment is lack of education. If we were able to go to that root cause and fix it, unemployment rates across the board would drop. This could be done by promoting educational programs. Another example is that by working with educational organizations, we would be able to give the unemployed the education they need to be qualified for jobs. For example, UNESCO is a UN organization that works to promote education, science, and culture. Their work involves giving people useful education that allows them to pursue their dream careers. If we work with organizations like UNESCO, we would be able to increase the access unemployed people have to higher education. Undoubtedly there are many root causes of unemployment, but if we can solve this major one, the others will be much easier to tackle. In conclusion, I will change the world by ending unemployment globally, and though there are many ways to end it, I will end it by creating charitable organizations, collaborating with governments globally, and supporting education-based programs. Unemployment is a treacherous reality many people must face, and though it is decreasing, it is not decreasing fast enough. Leading a group of people all working to help end unemployment would not be a burden to me, but instead a meaningful opportunity to address a crisis. We all have the potential to create change in the world, and I wish to fulfill that potential by ending unemployment.	Other People Matter. This is what Dr. Chris Peterson, one of the founders of positive psychology and a thesis advisor at the University of Michigan, used to sum up Positive Psychology. Dr.Peterson was the thesis advisor of Mike Erwin, one of the two co-founders of the positivity project, the other being Jeff Bryan. On February 18, 2015, which would have been Dr.Peterson’s 65th birthday, Mike and Jeff launched a Facebook page in honor of him and shared quotes, articles, and videos that exemplified the 24 character strengths. Within two months, Marc Herron, a childhood friend of Mike’s who was teaching second grade at Morgan Road Elementary reached out and said, “We need The Positivity Project at my school.” The Positivity Project looks to embody 24 different character strengths and to make people understand that other people matter. While there are many character strengths, I believe that creativity, teamwork, and leadership represent who I am now. “Creativity is putting your imagination to work, and it's produced the most extraordinary results in human culture” - Ken Robinson. Since I was in 3rd grade, I’ve participated in an international team competition called Odyssey of the Mind(OOTM). OOTM is a competition where students from Kindergarten to 12th grade are tested on big their imagination can get and the creative abilities someone holds. There are two parts to OOTM, a long-term project that matches a teams imagination with practicality by completing a specified problem while integrating it in a skit. The spontaneous part is where teams are given a problem and are is supposed to give as many answers in an allotted amount of time, and creative answers get more points. I started participating in this competition in 3rd grade, and I have done it all through elementary school. OOTM tested my creativity to breaking points, but it also helped me start to think more outside the box. Last year, our team won 1st place in regionals and 3rd place at the state competition, being 0.5 out of 250 points away from getting to the world competition. After seeing this, I can hopefully say that my creativity has grown, and will hopefully grow even more from this point on. Leadership is encouraging a group of people to get things done and at the same time maintaining good relations within the group; organizing group activities and seeing that they happen. I have experience in being in the lead role of a team; I’ve been the leader for many activities including Model UN, Boy Scouts, FACS, and many others. After being in a leadership role in these activities, I have learned many key things about leading a group of people with different needs. You have to make sure that everyone's voice is heard, so people who might not talk as much as others get to speak as much those who speak a lot. You’ve also have to find a way to include everyone's ideas in the group; in Model UN, you have to include each delegations idea in your bloc’s working paper for a resolution. Teamwork is defined by Merriam-Webster dictionary as “work done by several associates with each doing a part but all subordinating personal prominence to the efficiency of the whole”. In FACS, every time we make a recipe, we are all assigned roles on how everyone is going to contribute the creating the recipe and cleaning up after eating. Since everyone is assigned a role, everyone has to follow through with their role, because if someone doesn’t do their part, it will show in our grade for that label. In Boy Scouts, everyone in the troop is assigned a role, whether that's playing the trumpet as an alarm clock or leading the entire troop of scouts. Everyone in the troop has a unique role in the troop, and each role is key. All of these experiences have taught me how to be a better team player. While there are many character strengths that The Positivity Project embodies, I believe that creativity, teamwork, and leadership represent who I am now. I have shown and expanded my creative capabilities participating in events such as Odyssey of the Mind. I have learned how to be a better leader, making sure everyone's voices are heard in other activities like Model UN. I have also become a better team player through years of doing activities like soccer, Boy Scouts, and more. This is why I think that creativity, leadership, and teamwork character traits embody me more the other character traits.	All of our world leaders, politicians, philanthropists, and influencers say that we must end climate change, that we must do something to end this treacherous crisis our world is facing. But that has been said for decades now, yet this crisis is getting larger and larger at a rapid pace. Years have passed, but nothing is being done to impede the rapid growth of this global issue. By holding community clean-up events, we as communities would be taking this matter into our own hands, not just waiting for our government to take action. Not only would community clean-up events help the environment, but it would give students an opportunity to volunteer in their community as well as learn more about the world around them. Holding community clean-up events would improve our community because it would better the environment, promote better morals in students, and implement more unity within our community. Trash pollution impacts our community greatly, and we must do what we can to minimize its effects. To begin with, Trash pollution affects wildlife and nature, and community clean up events would lessen the trash impacting animals. For example, animals, from turtles to deer, are dying because of the pollution we are causing, including a turtle that was suffocated to death, tangled in a grocery bag. To show we truly care about the wildlife that shares this beautiful planet with us, we need to rid our communities of trash. Furthermore, trash also affects our daily lives, and to take care of ourselves, we should hold these clean-up events. To illustrate, as scientists have said, the toxins found in our community will eventually enter the dietary systems of wildlife, wildlife that non-vegetarian consumers will consume. What this translates to is that humans indirectly consume the pollution we find lying on the side of the roads due to it being found in the dietary systems of wildlife non-vegetarians consume. Trash pollution affects nature and the wildlife within, and we must do our best  to hold community cleanup events in order to minimize its effects. As the saying goes, “the children of today are the future of tomorrow,” and as a community, it is our duty to help them, so when the time comes, they are ready to take charge. For example, effective leadership is a crucial necessity to society, and these events would allow students an opportunity to learn and implement this valuable skill. To illustrate, when students see an adult take charge at an event, they are unconsciously and simultaneously learning the different aspects of the leadership being displayed. At community clean up events, students would be given the opportunites to see adult leadership in action and then show what they learned. Another example is that these events would teach children to be more caring and advocate for what they believe in. For example, these events will implement strong voices in kids in our community because these events will raise more awareness about the environment. Once children become truly passionate about the environment, they will use the strong voices inside of them to promote the idea of bettering the environment. If we as a community wish to support the growth of children, by implementing clean up we would be doing just that. Even though we spend every day living next to them, not many neighbors have close relationships with the rest of their neighbors, but these events would help bridge that gap. To demonstrate, clean up events would in a way force people to talk between one another, which would build strong relationships. To illustrate, by holding these events, you would begin to talk with people who live in your community. As neighbors interact at more and more cleanups, they will gradually grow strong relations with the rest of their neighbors which they would then be able to carry back into the neighborhood. Also, when a community uses their bond and comes together, nothing can stop their voices from being heard. For example, when a community becomes truly passionate about something, it will become advocates for that. And once they begin, a whole community does not stop until their voices are finally heard. This is how holding community clean up events would implement more community unity, which can only lead to greatness. In conclusion, conducting community clean up events is just the solution we need to better our community because it would help the environment, teach and allow students to implement valuable skills, and allow people to form stronger bonds with others. While some may say and argue that community clean up events are not the most effective change that can better a community, it’s clear to me that it is because it tackles key issues, all at the same time. From the streets of Manhattan to the halls of the White House, you will hear one common agreement, that we must end global warming. Global warming, along with student education and lack of unity are issues faced across the globe, and if we wish to end it, we must realize that the solution to these global issues begins at home, in the community. Holding community clean up events are the way our community can leave their mark on the end of these crises.
